              " \"''We wanted a building with a certain exuberance to it,'' said James T. Dowell, executive director of the Riverside Park Fund, about the Volunteer House, left, a light-hearted folly to rise next year above a one-story storage building near 106th Street. Today, it is pink-painted limestone with patches of graffiti (Mike Dottie 4life) underneath a verdigris coating of moss. The group, founded in 1986 to help pull the park's socks up, sees a day when gardening classes and volunteers will flock to this airy space nestled against the cliff below Riverside Drive. The problem has been how to encourage residents to enter the lovely park. The architect Jeffrey Murphy, of Murphy Burnham & Buttrick, who has designed Volunteer House, said, ''It's a commitment to get down there.'' The park drops 45 feet below Riverside Drive to the building, then farther, to a broad promenade, then even farther, to the active sports area along the Henry Hudson Parkway. Recently, volunteers have adopted rambles and gardens, a dog run was built and the Hudson Beach Cafe opened near the new all-weather soccer field, skate park and basketball courts, much of which is the work of the fund. ''For some people, the park is forbidding, but the whole area has seen a resurgence in the last few years,'' Mr. Dowell said. LINDA LEE CURRENTS: ARCHITECTURE\",\n",
              " \"Small-business owners and farmers whose Washington lobbyists are ardent backers of a Republican-backed plan to repeal the estate tax seem largely unaware that President Clinton -- who has vowed to veto the Republican proposal -- has said he would sign legislation that would exempt nearly all of them from the tax starting next year. Business owners and farmers would be allowed to leave $2 million -- $4 million for a couple -- to their heirs without paying estate taxes under the plan favored by the President and the Democratic leadership in Congress. The Republican proposal, which passed the House last month with some Democrats' support and is being debated in the Senate this week, would be phased in slowly, with the tax eliminated in 2009. Supporters of the Republican plan say the tax is so complicated that eliminating it is the only effective reform; they argue that the nation's growing wealth means more estates will steadily fall under the tax if it remains law on the Democratic proposal's terms. Still, had the Democratic plan been law in 1997, the last year for which estate tax return data is available from the Internal Revenue Service, the estates of fewer than 1,300 owners of closely held businesses and 300 farmers would have owed the tax. According to the data, 95 percent of the roughly 6,000 farmers who paid estate tax that year would have been exempted under terms of the Democrats' plan, as would 88 percent of the roughly 10,000 small-business owners who paid the tax. Had the estate tax been repealed in 1997, as the Republicans now propose, more than half of the tax savings would have gone to the slightly more than 400 individuals who died that year leaving individual estates worth more than $20 million each. Two prominent experts on estate taxes said yesterday that the Democrats were offering a much better deal to small-business owners and farmers, because the relief under their bill would be immediate and the estate tax would be eliminated for nearly all of them. ''The fact is that the Democrats are making the better offer -- and I'm a Republican saying that,'' said Sanford J. Schlesinger of the law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler in New York. With routine estate planning, he said, the $4 million exemption could effectively be raised to as much as $10 million in wealth that could be passed untaxed to heirs. Only 1,221 of the 2.3 million people who died in 1997 left a taxable estate of $10 million or more, I.R.S. data shows. Neil Harl, an Iowa State University economist who is a leading estate tax adviser to Midwest farmers, said that only a handful of working family farms had a net worth of $4 million. ''Above that, with a very few exceptions, you are talking about the Ted Turners who own huge ranches and are not working farmers,'' he said. Mr. Harl said he was surprised that farmers were not calling lawmakers to demand that they take the president up on his promise to sign the Democratic bill. One reason for that may be that in leading the call for repeal of the tax, two organizations representing merchants and farmers -- the National Federation of Independent Business and the American Farm Bureau Federation -- have done little to tell members about the Democratic plan. Interviews this week with half a dozen people whom the two organizations offered as spokesmen on the estate tax showed that only one of them had any awareness of the Democratic proposal. Officials of the business federation and the farm bureau said that in the event full repeal failed, they might push for approval of the Democratic plan. But both groups say outright repeal makes more sense. ''My concern is not over the Bill Gateses of the world,'' said Jim Hirni, a Senate lobbyist for the business federation. ''But we have to eliminate this tax, because it is too complicated to comply with the rules. Instead of further complicating the system, the best way is to eliminate the tax, period.'' A farm bureau spokesman, Christopher Noun, said that the Democrats' plan appeared to grant benefits that would erode over time. ''Farmers are not cash wealthy, they are asset wealthy,'' he said. ''And those assets are only going to continue to gain value over the years. So while some farmers may not be taxed now under the other plan -- 10 or 15 years out they will.'' Whether the proposal to repeal the tax dies in the Senate or is passed and then vetoed by the President, it will become a powerful tool for both parties in the fall elections. The Republicans will be able to paint themselves as tax cutters who would carry out their plans if they could just win the White House and more seats in Congress. The Democrats could try to paint the Republicans as the party that abandoned Main Street merchants and family farmers to serve the interests of billionaires. A vote in the Senate could come as early as this evening. At the grass roots, however, those who would benefit from any reduction in the scope of the estate tax take a much more pragmatic view of the matter. ''The whole reason I took up this cause is I do not want to see another small family business get into the situation we are in,'' said Mark Sincavage, a land developer in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania whose family expects to sell some raw land soon to pay a $600,000 estate tax bill to the federal and state governments. The independent business federation cited Mr. Sincavage's situation as an especially good example of problems the estate tax causes its members who are asset rich but short on cash. Facing similar circumstances is John H. Kearney, a Ford and Lincoln dealer in Ravena, N.Y., who said he ''got slammed pretty hard'' when his father died last year. Most of his father's $1.6 million estate was in land and the car dealership, said Mr. Kearney, who added that he dipped into savings intended for his children's education to pay the estate tax bill. Neither Mr. Sincavage nor Mr. Kearney said he was aware of the Democrats' plan to roll back the tax. But Mr. Kearney said his interest was in reasonable tax relief so that merchants and farmers could continue to nurture their businesses, not in helping billionaires. ''No part of me has any sympathy for people with more than $5 million,'' he said. ''Would I feel terrible if all they did was raise the exemption to $4 million or $5 million? I would say from my selfish standpoint that we have covered the small family farm and small business and thus we achieved what we wanted to achieve. ''But I would still be asking: Is it really a moral tax to begin with? And that's a point you can argue a hundred different ways.'' Carl Loop, 72, who owns a wholesale decorative-plant nursery in Jacksonville, Fla., said he favored repeal, partly because estate tax planning was fraught with uncertainty. ''The complexity of it keeps a lot of people from doing estate planning because they don't understand it,'' Mr. Loop said. ''And they don't like the fact that they have to give up ownership of property while they are alive.'' Professor Harl, the Iowa State University estate tax expert, said that he had heard many horror stories about people having to sell farms to pay estate taxes. But in 35 years of conducting estate tax seminars for farmers, he added, ''I have pushed and pushed and hunted and probed and I have not been able to find a single case where estate taxes caused the sale of a family farm; it's a myth.''\",\n",
              " \"For Indian playwrights, involvement in New York theater has been more a flirtation than anything serious. That has meant mostly short runs, small theaters and few mainstream audiences even for celebrated Indian playwrights. The growing Indian arts community here hopes to change this. Beginning on Friday, the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center is to host a Festival of Indian Theater, which will run for three weeks and include 18 performances. The festival is sponsored by the Indo-American Arts Council, whose director, Aroon Shivdasani, says it is the first such festival in North America. The festival will offer the United States premieres of two plays, in English with all-Indian casts, by two of India's leading playwrights. Mahesh Dattani's ''Dance Like a Man'' is about the conflict between two aging dancers of the classical temple style known as Bharata Natyam, whose careers are ending, and their daughter, whose career is taking off. It was written in English. Vijay Tendulkar's ''Once Upon A Fleeting Bird'' is an English adaptation of a contemporary love story set in Bombay. It was originally performed in the Marathi language. The Asia Society has organized a series of conversations with the playwrights, directors and casts before and after selected performances. ''Indian theater has been shown here, but it has been a one-night stand,'' said Ms. Shivdasani, who was a founder of the small, multicultural Bear Theater Company in Toronto. ''It's one night in Queens, one night in New Jersey, then it's out.'' The Indian plays draw a niche audience, she said. That means that American playgoers miss out on playwrights who are as well-known in their home country as Arthur Miller is here. The Indo-American Arts Council was started two years ago to introduce mainstream American audiences to Indian artists. A film screening or performance is often accompanied by a discussion about broader aspects of Indian culture. For information, call the box office at (212) -346-8510.\",\n",
              " \"As he waited to board a flight back to his native South Korea, Kim Tae Won still could not believe the reception his 40-person theater troupe had received all week from standing-room-only audiences in this provincial capital in southern Japan. After years of hearing stories about Japan tinged in mistrust and disdain, Mr. Kim, whose troupe was performing a historical play about a Mongol invasion of Japan via Korea, pronounced what amounted to a burying of the hatchet between two of Asia's most closely related, yet persistently contentious, neighbors. ''We don't have the old feelings of hatred toward Japan like we used to anymore,'' he said. ''And I guess our stay here shows that the Japanese have finally learned to respect us, too.'' The burgeoning detente between South Korea and Japan can be seen in many ways, from their agreeing to be co-hosts of the World Cup soccer tournament in 2002, to the increasingly frequent trips back and forth between leaders of the two countries, to South Korea's pending invitation of the Japanese emperor to Seoul, which, given Japan's bitterly resented imperial rule of Korea early this century, would have been unthinkable even just a few years ago. Mr. Kim visited during Korea Week in Fukuoka, where Korean master potters displayed their works and lectured Japanese audiences about ceramics, brought to this country from Korea centuries ago. And Korean flower arrangers showed off their innovations in an art largely inspired by ancient Japanese traditions. But the best reflection of the spreading warmth between the countries is the way travel between them -- not just by business people and officials, but by homemakers, students and ordinary tourists -- has exploded in the last few years, making South Korea the preferred destination of Japanese last year, replacing the longtime favorite, Hawaii. Travel between the countries is booming at a time of historic shifts in relationships throughout the region. Japan and South Korea are enjoying rare warmth in what had long been lucrative but frosty economic ties. For the first time in years, starting with a historic summit meeting of their leaders in June, North and South Korea have been making major progress toward ending the state of war between them. The thaw between North and South Korea, meanwhile, has encouraged the government in Pyongyang, North Korea, to moderate its often shrill rhetoric against Tokyo, and even begin hinting at a reconciliation with Japan, which North Korea usually depicts as the source of evil and corruption in Northeast Asia. The softer tone may reflect a recognition that capital from Japan -- which has the world's second largest economy -- will be indispensable for the reconstruction of a North Korea on the verge of collapse. It would be hard to find a sea boundary in Asia whose history has been more tumultuous or of deeper impact than the Korea Strait, a 100-mile-wide stretch of ocean separating Fukuoka from Pusan, in southern South Korea. Although the subject remains shrouded in mystery and is taboo here, Japan's imperial family is believed by many historians to have arrived from across these seas some 2,000 years ago. The Mongols, who ruled Korea, invaded twice and were defeated the second time only by a typhoon, the original kamikaze, or holy wind, which wrecked their armada of 3,500 ships in 1281. Three centuries later, feudal Japan launched two invasions of its own, involving 150,000 or so troops each time, but was undone by help from Chinese allies and Korea's invention of the world's first armored sea craft, the Turtle Ship. These days, the invasions are different but still aggressive: weekend shopping expeditions and culinary raids for spicy Korean kimchi or delicate Japanese specialties, or school trips, amusement park visits and health spa ''cures.'' Private visits between the two countries are taking place at a rate of more than two million a year, and because of its proximity to the Korean peninsula, Fukuoka, once the favored jumping-off point for conquerors, has become the leading springboard for travelers. Where diplomacy has often come up short in the past, growing contacts like these between South Korea and Japan seem to be changing the ways -- often deeply stereotyped -- the two peoples think about each other. Japanese people visit South Korea and discover a country far more orderly and developed than they had been led to believe. ''I had heard a lot about Korea before I went, but my impressions of the place were much better than the image I used to have,'' said Kyoko Fukuda, a Japanese beautician whose flight from Seoul, where she went to attend a conference, had just landed. ''We have always heard that the living standard is very low there, but in fact the difference was not so terribly great.'' South Koreans, meanwhile, are noting a greater willingness among Japanese to acknowledge them as peers rather than subjects and to acknowledge that Japanese culture has borrowed heavily from its western neighbor -- which is important given South Koreans' deep sense of national pride. In June, as a result, South Korea lifted restrictions on imports of Japanese films and most television programming. The measure follows a more timid relaxation of controls on ''cultural imports'' from Japan that began in 1988. ''The Japanese were deeply influenced by Korea,'' said Lee Kang Hyo, a South Korean ceramics artist who lectured recently in Fukuoka, where Korean masterpieces were on display at a municipal exhibition hall, along with historical correspondence from Hideyoshi, the Japanese shogun who twice invaded the country. ''But you have to come to Japan to see the best of our classical tradition preserved.'' That fact has much to do, Mr. Lee hastened to add, with Japan's 35-year colonization of Korea, which ended in 1945, and its previous conquest of the country, when Korean masterpieces were carted off to Japan in large quantities. But he said he was also surprised to learn during his first visit to Fukuoka, last month, that there was still a deep sense of prestige attached to the classical Korean style here. Japanese academics, meanwhile, say that they have begun to work closely together with their Korean counterparts to piece together the shared history of the two peoples, overcoming a legacy of mutual contempt. ''It is safe to say that Japan had a feeling of superiority over Korea,'' said Koji Saeki, a professor of history at Kyushu University, in Fukuoka. ''But the exchanges between Japanese and Korean scholars are very active now, and they are strengthening all the time.'' It is in the area of the painful history that has long divided the two peoples that the most distance has been traveled. Only in fits and starts has the Japanese government shown a willingness to address the question of Japanese imperial rule over the Korean peninsula, apologizing officially to the Korean government, but devoting relatively little attention in officially sanctioned textbooks to Japanese brutality, like the use of Korean women as sex slaves for the imperial army. Prominent Japanese politicians, meanwhile, periodically continue to make provocative statements about Koreans in Japan, blaming them for crime, for example. Individual Japanese who have traveled to South Korea, however, say that their experience of the country has brought them to reflect deeply about their own country's expansionist past. Often they express a kind of remorse whose sincerity rings far truer than any official declaration. South Korean tour guides play a subtle but important role, deliberately bringing Japanese visitors to sites that commemorate the sacking of their country and attempted destruction of their culture by several generations of Japanese invaders. ''We learned almost nothing about this in school,'' said Makiko Nakatsukuma, a 27-year-old homemaker, who had just traveled with her best friend to Pusan by high-speed ferry for a weekend of shopping. ''In Korea it was explained to us how Japan had forced Koreans to learn our language, and to abandon their names in favor of Japanese names. Many Koreans were brought to Japan by force, too, and had to work as virtual slaves. ''The whole time I was there, I just felt like apologizing to the Korean people. It is very hard to explain, but even though I am from the postwar generations, I felt so bad about all of this. You want to say you are sorry, but who do you say it to?''\",\n",

              " \"Affluence is supposed to bring contentment: the satisfaction of basic physical needs, the resources to enjoy more refined pleasures. But in Dave Matthews's songs, affluence can't stave off a crisis that might as well be called spiritual. It leaves him confused, lonely, appalled at his own daily compromises and longing for release. Love would help; God might help, too. But he's not sure he can hold on to either one. At Giants Stadium here on Tuesday night, opening a three-night stand, Mr. Matthews sang, ''I can't believe that we would lie in our graves/Dreaming of things that we might have been.'' His music, at first, seems too fragile and intricate for a stadium show. The songs revolve around Mr. Matthews strumming an acoustic guitar, singing in a voice that rarely finds peace; it broods somewhere between Eddie Vedder and Cat Stevens. There's no bombast in his band of saxophone, violin, bass, drums and keyboards. Most of the time, the music is a briskly syncopated latticework, riding the pinpoint accents that Carter Beauford taps across cymbals, wood blocks and drums. Yet it's not as delicate as it might seem. Boyd Tinsley's violin pulls the songs toward Celtic folk melodies; LeRoi Moore's saxophone and flute solos tilt them toward jazz, and the whole band can mesh for sinewy funk riffs. The music reaches for hybrids, pulling in Fairport Convention, James Brown and Weather Report, slipping into odd meters and piling up prickly dissonances. And for all its ambitions, it creates a sleek momentum. Even when Mr. Matthews sings about being trapped or unsure, the music moves along, and plenty of fans are ready to dance to it. In the last few years Mr. Matthews has become a stadium regular, with thousands of voices singing along as he ponders reasons to live. In a two-and-a-half-hour set, the band progressed from thoughts of overconsumption and overwork in ''Too Much'' to questions about purpose in ''Lie in Our Graves,'' ''Typical Situation'' and a newer song, ''Bartender,'' in which Mr. Matthews prays that money and success not ruin him. Eventually, it found its way to lusty romance, ending with the jubilant ''Rapunzel.'' The band's music is still evolving. Having perfected its own syncopated pointillism, it is testing richer, more sustained textures. ''Bartender,'' based on one long-held chord, pealed like a U2 song, and in another new song, ''Busted Stuff,'' Mr. Matthews and three female backup singers repeated the line ''You're the one for me'' again and again, a mantra of longing and obsession that became richly hypnotic. Remarkably, Mr. Matthews and his band can make a whole stadium look inward. Two opening acts shared the bill. Ben Harper and his band, the Innocent Criminals, are a paradoxical blend of diffidence and arena dynamics. Mr. Harper spent most of the set seated, playing a lap slide guitar and singing in a haunted, androgynous voice about idealistic goals and thwarted love. But from that guitar came muscular blues and boogie licks, climbing toward distorted peaks. The combination was like Led Zeppelin with politically correct self-consciousness instead of bravado. Ozomatli, from Los Angeles, is a polyglot party band. Its first song jumped from samba to merengue within four minutes, and in the course of its set it also touched on hip-hop, dance-hall reggae and Mexican cumbia, all played with gusto and nuance. After finishing its set onstage, Ozomatli paraded into the audience like a brass band, playing a mini-set that mixed samba propulsion with musical quotations from Metallica, Duke Ellington and the ''Looney Tunes'' theme. Ozomatli songs call for unity amid diversity, and its music lived up to that goal. POP REVIEW\",\n",
              " \"Four banks that serve about one-third of bank customers in New York State have agreed to stop discouraging consumers from opening low-cost basic accounts, state officials said. The companies -- the Chase Manhattan Corporation, KeyCorp, the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company and HSBC Bank USA -- agreed in a settlement with the attorney general's office to follow a state law that requires them to provide the basic bank accounts. They also agreed to spend $300,000 on a statewide advertising campaign to promote the low-cost accounts. The agreement came after a yearlong investigation by the attorney general's regional office in Syracuse. The investigation was started after a consumer complained that a Chase bank in Syracuse would not allow her to open a low-cost account. Under the informal agreement, the attorney general's office has agreed not to sue the companies if they comply with the law and undertake the consumer ad campaign. Charlotte Gilbert-Biro, a spokeswoman for Chase Manhattan, which banking officials say accounts for about 23 percent of the state's customers, said the company was ''happy to be doing this'' as a part of ''our ongoing efforts'' to inform consumers. Banks are required to offer low-cost accounts under a 1994 state law. Consumers could open such an account with a deposit of as little as $25. Account holders must maintain a minimum monthly balance of 1 cent, and they are charged a monthly maintenance fee of no more than $3. The accounts allow for eight free withdrawals each month and third-party check cashing at no cost to the consumer. Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer said yesterday that ''access to low-cost accounts is a right of all New Yorkers.'' He said that the people who suffered most from unavailability of the low-cost accounts were the poor and the elderly, who often have to rely on check-cashing services that charge a percentage of the check total as a fee. Mr. Spitzer said his investigators found ''industrywide noncompliance'' with the law on low-cost bank accounts and would soon begin discussions with other institutions. Russ Haven, legislative counsel of the New York Public Interest Research Group, which lobbied for the 1994 law, praised the agreement, but said, ''The other part of this story is that the Banking Department has done an awful job enforcing the law and ensuring that the banks promote low-cost checking accounts.'' State Banking Department officials disputed that assertion. An official said there were about one million basic accounts in the state.\",\n",

Wireless photo transmission is being made possible by Digita Post software currently available in Kodak DC290 digital cameras. The software, developed by FlashPoint Technology, based in San Jose, Calif., works with the company's Digita technology, which functions as an operating system for digital cameras. Transmitting photos from digital cameras to cell phones and then to any e-mail box anywhere in the world is expected to be particularly handy for insurance adjusters, police officers and paramedics, though the biggest market for the cameras is expected to be among nonprofessionals, said Karen Meyers, a company spokeswoman. A user inserts a flash card into the camera and takes standard digital photos. Then the user starts up the camera's Digita Post software, which allows the user to select which photos to send and even attach text and sound messages (the Kodak DC290 has a tiny microphone). The camera is then connected to a cell phone through a cable. With another click, the photos are on their way. They arrive in the receiver's e-mail In box as a message with an attached JPEG file. Sounds arrive as WAV file attachments. Digita Post is expected to cost $199 and will be available in late September on the FlashPoint Web site (www.flashpoint.com). Other camera manufacturers that offer Digita-enabled cameras -- including Minolta, Hewlett-Packard and Sharp -- are expected to incorporate the Digita Post software, too, Ms. Meyers said.

              " \"In 1995, the year before state education officials stepped in to overhaul the troubled Roosevelt school district on Long Island, just four graduating seniors received the respected Regents diplomas, symbolizing academic success in a host of subject areas. This year, after five years of the state's efforts, 6 students did so, out of a graduating class of 107. By almost any measure, the Roosevelt Free Union School District has barely improved and the state's attempt to turn it around is in disarray. The chairman of the state advisory panel that oversees the district resigned last month, the third change in the panel's leadership in five years. For months this spring, members of the state panel and the Roosevelt Board of Education were barely speaking to one another. The school district, meanwhile, has employed four superintendents in five years. Now, with one year remaining in the state's legislative mandate to set the district's 3,000 students on a path toward academic success, the effort is at a critical crossroads. Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, told the Roosevelt Board of Education this week that the district must show measurable progress this year in four areas -- local leadership, curriculum, financial stability and community support -- or face further state intervention. The district's students, he added, must meet specific targets on standardized tests in math and in English. Today, Mr. Mills will tell the Board of Regents what he plans to do if the district does not meet those goals. His options, however, appear to be limited. Simply ending state oversight without demonstrable academic progress would be an admission of failure at a time when Gov. George E. Pataki's administration is seeking to impose tougher learning standards on students throughout the state. And the district itself is confronting severe budget constraints, brought on by voters who rejected a construction bond issue and defeated proposed tax increases that would have raised school spending. Meanwhile, several members of the Board of Regents, including Chancellor Carl T. Hayden, oppose a direct takeover of Roosevelt's operations. A more severe option would be to revoke the registration of the Roosevelt middle and high schools and disperse its students. But people on all sides of the debate over Roosevelt schools say that option could be too politically charged to carry out, given that the district's students, who are overwhelmingly black and Hispanic, would have to be transferred to schools that are far more affluent and largely white. And the state has a significant investment beyond the district, as it tackles problems at 104 other failing schools, 97 of them in New York City. Critics of state supervision point to the lack of progress at Roosevelt, and ask whether the state's floundering role there indicates deeper flaws in the state's program for imposing tough standards on failing schools statewide. Mr. Mills said in an interview that Roosevelt's elementary schools had improved in recent years, and that the district had made progress in renovating crumbling buildings. But in the middle and high schools, continual turnover in teachers and administrators combined with the instability in the district's leadership have made any sustained progress all but impossible, he said. In Roosevelt, news of Mr. Mills's mandates for this year -- and the implied threat of more severe action next year -- raised hackles among some residents at a Board of Education meeting on Tuesday night. ''Now that they've made a mess of things, they're trying to put the onus on our board of education,'' said Serretta C. McKnight, who was president of the school board that was removed by the State Education Department in 1996. ''They want us to do lickety-split what they haven't done in five years.'' Since 1990, the Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School, a combined school that the state wants to split up, has been listed as underperforming, with low test scores and low graduation rates. In March 1995, a state panel issued a harshly critical review, leading the State Legislature to grant Governor Pataki's request for intervention. While the legislation authorized the removal of the school board, a move the state took in early 1996, it left long-term governance to a new school board, elected a few months later. Since then, the state's power has been limited to advising the new board on recommended reforms. The state has also provided financial support, including legislative approval of an advance of $4 million in each of the last several years when the district essentially ran out of money before the end of the fiscal year. Better fiscal management is one of the state's goals for the district this year, Mr. Mills said. Entwined with that, he added, is the need to improve relations between the district and local residents, who have voted down school budget increases in each of the last two years. Last month, voters also defeated a $70 million school construction bond issue. Because of those votes the district, which is in southern Nassau County, faces a second straight year of a so-called austerity budget, which limits any spending increase to the level of inflation. Meanwhile, a charter school is scheduled to open in the fall, which will take $1.7 million out of the district's $35 million budget. In a school district with high poverty rates and virtually no commercial tax base, paying for the school system is a continuing problem. ''The people who live here are overassessed and overtaxed,'' said Francis Cooper, a Roosevelt resident who regularly attends school board meetings. ''But the state, in coming to Roosevelt, didn't bring any financial resources to the table. They gave us a loan of $4 million, which actually puts us further in the hole.'' Mr. Mills contends, however, that the district has harmed itself, in part by not applying for grants and other state money for which the district is eligible. Mark Davis, who was elected president of the Roosevelt school board on Tuesday, said the board had begun to formulate plans to achieve the commissioner's goals, including his directive to hire chairmen for its math and English departments. In addition, a recently approved teachers' contract raises pay scales and should reduce teacher turnover. While Roosevelt's per pupil spending and teacher salaries are above the state average, they have been below that of nearby districts. But Mr. Davis said the state had failed to provide the financial resources necessary to allow the district to hire the administrators it needed to accomplish the changes the state wanted. ''The board is not short of plans to improve the district; we're short of people to execute the plans,'' he said. On all sides, participants have pointed fingers at others who they say are to blame for the district's problems. Michael Mostow, who retired as superintendent last month after losing the support of the board, said the State Education Department contained mainly theorists who did not have the skills to help a district with day-to-day operations. Ken Stubbolo, who resigned last month as a member of the state advisory board, said the Roosevelt Board of Education thwarted the efforts of the state advisers, who were in turn hamstrung by the Legislature's failure to give the oversight panel any operational responsibility. There is plenty of blame to go around, said the Rev. Reginald Tuggle, pastor of Memorial Presbyterian Church in Roosevelt, who once worked with the state panel and who is now on the board of the recently approved charter school. ''There has been an absence of constructive parental and community involvement,'' he said. ''I know everybody means well -- the state, the school board and the administration. But this is a small school district. I don't know why they can't pull this together. It's hurting our children.''\",\n",
              " \"A startling photograph has surfaced showing Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey grinning while frisking a black man who has his hands up and is facing a wall. The picture was taken on a night in 1996 when she accompanied state troopers who were patrolling in Camden. The man she frisked had apparently already been searched by the troopers for weapons and drugs and then handed over to the governor. The man had not been accused of any crime. The picture has caused a furor, and Mrs. Whitman is now criticizing her critics for taking the picture ''out of context.'' But the fact remains that the posed look of the photograph and Mrs. Whitman's smiling expression add up to the appearance of a gratuitous insult. The controversy over the photo may also help explain why Mrs. Whitman has had so much trouble putting the political problem of racial profiling by New Jersey state troopers behind her. One reason the issue will not disappear is that racial profiling -- the targeting and searching of motorists based solely on race -- has gone on for years, despite denials by political leaders like Mrs. Whitman. Also, the anger and mistrust in minority communities over this issue are deeply rooted, despite Mrs. Whitman's subsequent acknowledgment of the problem and her efforts to deal with it. The photograph simply feeds that anger and mistrust. Mrs. Whitman insists the episode had nothing to do with racial profiling. But that does not change the fact that the man in the picture was treated callously by the person who is chiefly responsible for setting the direction and tone of law enforcement in the state. To be fair, Mrs. Whitman was the first New Jersey governor to acknowledge that state troopers had engaged in systematic racial profiling. In the past year she began efforts to combat profiling as part of a consent decree entered into between the state and the Justice Department. She has also conceded that state police commanders have tolerated racial and sexual discrimination against minority and female officers. In the face of numerous lawsuits brought by former state troopers, she has ordered an overhaul of the agency's hiring and promotion practices and its command structure. But those bureaucratic reforms do not take the sting out of the photo. Mrs. Whitman's refusal to apologize for the conduct in the photo adds to public skepticism that her administration will energetically crack down on illegal policing practices. A lawyer for two troopers who have been criminally charged for shooting three unarmed minority men on the New Jersey Turnpike has already said the photo will be used to support their contention that racial profiling was encouraged by the police leadership. If the governor cares to heal the mistrust, she needs to show that she understands why the picture is offensive to so many people.\",\n",

              " \"Marcel Ospel, the chief executive of UBS A.G. in Zurich, built much of his career by buying American. But while his $12 billion deal to acquire the PaineWebber Group gives his huge Swiss bank a big new position in the United States, Mr. Ospel is in many ways a man under fire. UBS, formed through the merger in 1998 of the Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation, has spent much of the last two years struggling to find its focus and balance. Its previous chief executive, Mathis Cabiallavata, resigned after UBS amassed huge losses lending money to the ill-fated American hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management. Mr. Ospel, 50, former head of Swiss Bank, took over with the goals of sharply reducing the combined bank's exposure to risk and refocusing on what seemed to be its essential strength as a Swiss bank with global reach: managing money for wealthy individuals worldwide. But Swiss banking is under siege from global competition, as are banks across Europe. Much of that competition is from Wall Street investment banks, which have aggressively moved into the role of advisers to top European corporations. Much of the pressure also comes from the United States' standing as the biggest and probably fastest-growing market for affluent financial customers. Although UBS is one of the world's biggest banks, with roughly $1 trillion in assets under management, its vaunted private banking business slumped badly last year. Just today, UBS disclosed that profit in its private banking area dropped 18 percent in the second quarter just ended, compared with the first quarter. In a terse announcement regarding its second-quarter earnings, UBS said ''preliminary indications are that net new money and asset growth remain disappointing.'' That news comes three months after Mr. Ospel ousted the previous head of private banking and announced a broad restructuring of the operation. Mr. Ospel has also been under tremendous pressure, from investors as well as some UBS executives, to sell the investment banking business Warburg Dillon Read. That did not happen, but UBS did scale back on its trading activities in the United States and many Warburg executives defected to other firms. The PaineWebber deal is supposed to solve these and other problems. Using PaineWebber's network of 8,500 brokers in the United States, Mr. Ospel hopes to reach a huge new market of wealthy Americans, shore up his wobbly private banking business and sharply increase UBS's total assets under management. The bank is paying a high price for PaineWebber, 47 percent above the broker's stock price before the deal was announced. To keep more executives from fleeing to rivals, UBS has allocated $875 million for incentive payments. And it estimates restructuring costs around $400 million. Analysts predict that PaineWebber will not do much to help Warburg take on the likes of the Goldman Sachs Group or Merrill Lynch in the hotly competitive arenas of advising on mergers and acquisitions and corporate finance. Though Warburg has a strong investment banking business in Europe, it is considered second tier in the United States, and PaineWebber's primary strength is as a retail broker. But industry experts said UBS did not have many realistic choices of American partners, and PaineWebber's strengths should complement those of UBS. ''It makes a lot of sense strategically,'' said Madeleine Hofmann, banking analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in Zurich. ''UBS Warburg has very good people in private banking and investment banking, but in the U.S. they really did not have retail distribution. The major point is to build the affluent-client segment abroad, outside Switzerland.'' Others had lukewarm reactions. ''It is not the ideal acquisition, but realistically it is as close to the ideal as you can get,'' said Bryan Crossley, a banking analyst at ABN Amro. ''It doesn't really get them to the top level, but to do that you would have had to acquire somebody like Merrill Lynch, which is a different proposition.'' Mr. Ospel has considerable experience with American acquisitions. At the old Swiss Bank Corporation, he played a central role in 1995 in acquiring SG Warburg, then a dreary spinoff from Morgan Stanley, and in 1997 he acquired Dillon Read, then a boutique corporate advisory firm. Swiss Bank also acquired two small but valuable firms in Chicago: a derivatives business, O'Connor Associates, that gave it a solid base in what turned out to be a profitable area of trading, and Brinson Asset Management, a thriving money management firm. Industry executives say that Swiss Bank, smaller and scrappier than the Union Bank of Switzerland, did a good job of melding the longtime rivals together and letting executives who were not Swiss continue to build those businesses on their own. By some estimates, Warburg Dillon Read might have sold for as much as $18 billion if UBS had offered it last year. Some of UBS's problems reflect the rocky integration of its two Swiss components. Mr. Cabiallavata came from the bigger but stodgier Union Bank; Mr. Ospel from Swiss Bank. Mr. Cabiallavata pushed through a grueling cutback, closing branches and getting rid of many executives. When Mr. Cabiallavata resigned, taking responsibility for the losses incurred on the loans to Long-Term Capital, Mr. Ospel took over and the company came largely under the management of former Swiss Bank executives. UBS performance improved considerably in 1999, as net income doubled from 6.3 billion Swiss francs, or about $3.9 billion. Much of that gain came from Warburg's investment banking business, which surged as the financial markets did in general. But profit in private banking shrank 39 percent and the bank's asset management business lost many big customers. INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS\",\n",
              " \"Two centuries after George Washington signed into law a bill establishing a federal city on the Potomac, historians and lawmakers are now learning that most of the laborers who erected the White House and the Capitol were black slaves. A local television reporter, Edward Hotaling, several months ago unearthed Treasury Department pay slips in the Capitol dating back 200 years. The pay slips showed that from 1792 to 1800 -- the years the reporter zeroed in on -- more than 400 of the 600 workers who helped erect the White House and the Capitol were black slaves whose wages were appropriated by their owners. Now a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Congress, led by Representative J. C. Watts Jr., Republican of Oklahoma, is calling for a task force to study the documents and recommend how best to commemorate the black slaves, who were never recognized or rewarded for their role. The memorial would occupy a ''prominent'' place in the Capitol, Mr. Watts said. ''Who were these men who worked here?'' asked Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and a one-time civil rights leader. ''What happened to them?'' Representative Danny K. Davis, Democrat of Illinois, said it was important to honor the slaves who helped erect two of the country's most visible symbols of democracy, and not shy away from that fact. ''Slavery indeed was a shameful period in the history of this nation but we have a responsibility not to run away from any aspect of it,'' Mr. Davis said. ''It's incumbent upon us to uncover and reveal what was actually taking place.'' Mr. Hotaling said he came across the records in March while he was reporting a story on the 200th anniversary of the White House and the Capitol. Each pay slip contained the name of the plantation owner, the slave and the wages paid to the owner: $5 a month. Mr. Hotaling said he focused on the years 1792 and 1800, and then ran out of time. Construction of the Capitol was not completed until the 1860's, and the White House was finished in 1800. Slavery was not outlawed in Washington until 1865. Little else is known about the slave laborers, something Mr. Watts said he hoped to rectify with the task force, which would include several historians. Mr. Watts said he expected the resolution to sail through the House and Senate in the next month, adding that he would like the task force to make its recommendations by year's end. In the Senate, the resolution is being sponsored by Senators Spencer Abraham, Republican of Michigan, and Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas. It will be called, Mr. Watts said with a chuckle, the Abraham Lincoln resolution.\",\n",
              " \"Saying that globalization is showing no signs of slowing and that further international financial crises are all but inevitable, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, offered a wide-ranging set of prescriptions last night for preventing and coping with acute economic problems around the world. Drawing on lessons learned during the financial crisis that began in Asia in 1997, Mr. Greenspan said industrialized and developing countries alike needed to focus on developing strong banking systems and active capital markets so that if one source of financing dried up, another would be available. He stressed the need for governments to regulate their financial systems adequately, for governments and the private sectors to provide investors with full and timely economic and financial information, and for governments not to insulate investors from risk by bailing them out when times become tough. And he warned about allowing a buildup of debt within the financial system. Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Mr. Greenspan did not mention current economic conditions in the United States or provide any hints about whether the Fed would raise interest rates again when it meets next, on Aug. 22. Mr. Greenspan is scheduled to testify about monetary policy before the Senate Banking Committee next Thursday. Mr. Greenspan broke no new ground in his speech. But he said it was ''essential that we employ the current period of relative international financial stability to address as best we can some of the more evident short-run potentials for crises.'' The key, he said, is to develop ''flexible institutions that can adapt to the unforeseeable needs of the next crisis, not financial Maginot lines.'' One reason to be flexible, he said, is the complexity of the financial transactions and instruments through which capital flows around the world. The best insurance against allowing a nasty surprise to develop under the cloak of complexity, he suggested, is to limit the amount of debt in the system. Mr. Greenspan spent much of his speech building a case that countries with both strong banking systems and healthy capital markets were far better able to weather financial troubles than countries that have only one or the other. Countries like Thailand and Japan that relied heavily, if not exclusively, on their banking systems found themselves without another steady source of capital when their banks ran into trouble, he said. But countries like the United States and Sweden, he said, have come through crises relatively unscathed because they were able to turn to banks when their capital markets landed in trouble, and vice versa.\",\n",
              " \"A 24-year-old woman was slashed to death inside her Queens apartment yesterday by three men who also nailed the hands of her live-in boyfriend to a two-by-four and took thousands of dollars from a safe, the police said. The police did not release the name of the woman, pending notification of her family. They said she worked as a topless dancer at Ten's, a cabaret in Manhattan, and was thought to have been from Canada. They found her with her throat slashed early yesterday in her apartment on 135th Street in the Briarwood neighborhood. The man described by the police as her boyfriend, Todd Taylor, 34, was taken to Mary Immaculate Hospital, treated for injuries to his hands and released about 10 a.m., said Daphne Lawrence, a hospital spokeswoman. Mr. Taylor's hands had been nailed behind his back to a wooden post with two nails apiece, said Lt. Stephen Biegel, a police spokesman. Mr. Taylor called 911 at 4:24 a.m., but it was not clear how, the police said. Mr. Taylor told investigators that he awoke early yesterday to find three men, clad in stocking masks and gloves, inside the apartment. Further details about the victims and the crime, including the amount of money taken, were sketchy yesterday. Outside the three-story red-brick house in a quiet neighborhood of tree-lined streets, a steady flow of police investigators streamed in and out. They collected evidence throughout the day. A driveway at the apartment building was marked off with four bright orange cones and red tape. Neighbors watched as the police removed a body bag from the apartment building just after 1:30 p.m. Few seemed to know anything about the couple. Anthony Sorensen, 21, who lives in a building across the street, said he had occasionally seen the woman coming and going, but did not know her name. Mr. Sorensen, who was walking his two pit bulls yesterday, said that earlier the police had asked him whether he had heard anything unusual the night before. He told them that he had not and that his dogs, who usually bark if they hear a disturbance in the neighborhood, were quiet Tuesday night, he said. Like other residents, he was surprised by the crime. ''Nothing really happens here, maybe a stolen car occasionally,'' he said. ''But we don't hear about stuff like this happening. It's kind of scary.'' A woman who answered the telephone yesterday at Ten's, at 35 East 21st Street, said the club had not been contacted by police investigators.\",\n",

              " \"Overlooking Park Avenue on one of the choicest pieces of real estate in the city, the red brick Seventh Regiment Armory is considered both an architectural treasure and one of the country's leading showplaces for internationally renowned art, antiques and crafts exhibitions. But it is also viewed as a wasted opportunity, a long-neglected, badly deteriorated structure with crumbling ceilings and leaky walls, where space for which exhibition promoters clamor is rented out for a pittance. Seeking to reverse the armory's long decline and turn it into a money-making cultural center, the state yesterday invited nonprofit organizations and private companies to submit proposals for rehabilitating and operating the building, which occupies a full block between 66th and 67th Streets. City officials and civic leaders praised the state yesterday for recognizing the building's importance as a prime example of late Victorian architecture and design and coming up with sound criteria for restoring its grandeur. ''This clearly establishes that the use has to be consistent with the historic character of the armory and respectful of one of our most important neighborhoods,'' said Kent Barwick, the president of the Municipal Art Society, referring to the state's request for proposals. Mr. Barwick is also a board member of the Seventh Regiment Armory Conservancy, a nonprofit group that is expected to bid for the armory contract. Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development arm, said he expected several bidders to emerge. State officials said the Whitney Museum of American Art is interested in the site, but museum officials declined to confirm that yesterday. Kurt Masur, the music director of the New York Philharmonic, has said he would like to set up a summer home for the orchestra in the armory. ''I know that he is certainly interested,'' said a spokesman, Eric Latsky. And the Seventh Regiment Fund, a private organization that has been engaged in a protracted legal battle with the state over the ownership of the armory's multimillion-dollar collection of paintings and military regalia, is seeking to turn the armory into a military and decorative arts museum, said David L. Dalva II, an antiques dealer and the group's vice president. But to succeed, a bidder will have to have access to deep pockets. Mr. Gargano said it would cost an estimated $50 million to repair the armory. The structure was built with private funds between 1877 and 1881 as the headquarters of the socially prominent Seventh Regiment, which held social events to attract and maintain its elite volunteer membership. The armory's dozen ornate rooms, decorated by some of the nation's most prominent interior designers, are among the finest surviving examples of the American Esthetic Movement. Some of the interior was designed by the architect Stanford White and furnished by Louis Comfort Tiffany. In recent years, large sections of the armory have been unused, Mr. Gargano said, adding, ''Any building that's not fully used always has a tendency to deteriorate.'' Before issuing the request for proposals, the state spent two years consulting with community and civic groups. But a housing shelter there remains a source of contention. Some community leaders said yesterday that they were disappointed that the state had not insisted on preserving the city shelter for homeless women that has occupied the third and fifth floors of the armory for about 15 years. The state said that prospective developers would not be required to accommodate the shelter, although they are not precluded from doing so. Nancy Wackstein, the executive director of the Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, a nonprofit organization that operates the shelter for the city, said she had hoped that the state would encourage developers to retain the home, which currently houses 100 women who are 45 and older and is the only publicly financed homeless shelter on the Upper East Side. ''We were hoping for more affirmative statements that the shelter can and should remain,'' Ms. Wackstein said. ''If it's displaced, there's no place else for it to go. This community, as every other community, has a responsibility to help address the homeless problem.'' She said that at the very least, developers who plan to include a shelter should be given preference by the state. M. Barry Schneider, the chairman of Community Board 8, whose district includes the armory, said that keeping the shelter had been one of the community's overriding concerns during its meetings with state officials. ''They have not been a problem,'' Mr. Schneider said of the shelter, ''and they do good work. They ought to have been given a better deal.'' City and state officials, however, said the shelter had wound up in the Armory only as an emergency measure and would need to be moved anyway while extensive renovations are made. Jennifer J. Raab, chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission and the city's representative on the state's armory advisory council, said the city would help Ms. Wackstein to find another location if necessary. The deadline for submitting proposals to the state is Oct. 16. A short list of finalists will be announced on Jan. 15. State officials said they expected to choose a final bid by spring of next year.\",\n",
              " \"Tony Earley and his wife, Sarah Bell Earley, were standing in their mustard-yellow kitchen, opening mail. ''French's Mustard yellow,'' Ms. Earley said. ''If you hold the jar up to the wall, it's almost identical.'' The Earleys had been on the road for six weeks, promoting Mr. Earley's first novel, ''Jim the Boy,'' published by Little, Brown last month. Mr. Earley read a congratulatory postcard from a college acquaintance. ''He stole my girl in 1984,'' Mr. Earley said, with some humor and some pique. ''And now he's writing me a postcard. I suppose he thinks I forgot.'' Things worked out, as stories involving writers often do. The Earleys, from the same town in North Carolina, Rutherfordton, married in 1993. ''I grew up in a very tiny country Baptist church,'' Mr. Earley said, sitting in the vestibule of their five-room Victorian house in a gentrifying neighborhood of English-cottage gardens and late-model Saabs and chainlink fenced front yards with plastic doghouses and mongrel dogs. ''I started going to the Episcopal church in our hometown just to impress another woman I was dating at the time, and developed a crush on this girl who sang in the choir. Sitting in church I felt like just a complete heel, because I was there with my girlfriend, but I was longing for this girl in the choir. ''I married the girl in the choir.'' Mr. Earley's first book, ''Here We Are in Paradise,'' short stories, was published in 1994. He was chosen by Granta in 1996 as one of the 20 best young American writers, and in 1999 by The New Yorker as one of ''20 writers for the 21st century.'' Mr. Earley, 39, has taught writing at Vanderbilt University since 1997. ''Jim the Boy'' is the crystalline story of a year in the life of Jim Glass, a 10-year-old boy growing up in rural North Carolina during the Depression. Mr. Earley said that he wrote the book in the style of children's classics like ''Charlotte's Web'' and ''The Yearling,'' as ''a children's book for adults.'' Janet Maslin reviewing it in The New York Times, called the novel a ''radiant, knowing, pitch-perfect parable of childhood.'' Mr. Earley's own childhood and adulthood have been darker. He battles depression: the bright scars of his most recent bout grace the walls as colorful folk paintings he made when he couldn't write. ''After 'Here We Are in Paradise' came out, I got sick, and stayed sick for a couple of years,'' said Mr. Earley, who speaks quietly and carefully, and with the occasional running jump of an enthusiastic boy. ''I was on the suicide watch for a while. I didn't know if I'd ever write again.'' He started painting on a stack of discarded storm windows, then slowly writing, too. ''I bought a bunch of cheap paint at Wal-Mart and I started making big words on them,'' he said. ''That's how I started coming out of it: one big word at a time.'' Mr. Earley discounted any therapeutic interpretation of his new book, but said of the nearly clairvoyant simplicity of Jim's impressions, ''On some level that I didn't understand, I wrote the book that I needed to read.'' Without bearings, in unfamiliar country at the end of the book, Jim asks, ''Which way is home?'' By the author's implication, it is a child's question that most adults spend their lives answering. ''I was way too sensitive for life on planet Earth,'' Mr. Earley said of himself when he was Jim's age. ''Noises were too long and lights were too bright and my feelings were always hurt. It was just because, I think, I was so incredibly thin-skinned.'' Mr. Earley's father was a welder; his mother worked in a department store. His sister was killed in an automobile accident when he was a freshman at Warren Wilson College in Asheville. ''We grew up in a suburb of a town with 3,000 people in it,'' he said. Mr. Earley's parents' marriage was troubled until he returned from college as an adult, a tension he said dispossessed his happiness in the house. Mr. Earley liked his maternal grandmother's house, ''a big old folk Victorian'' with a parlor and Sunday furniture as he called it, where the preacher sat when he visited. In his book, Mr. Earley has turned a child's sensitivities into writerly strengths; domestic events have an extraordinary witness. Jim's father dies without warning the week before he is born; at 10, he is as old as his mother's unending grief. By his 11th birthday, he has stepped into the world, wading into its strong waters on a trip to the Atlantic Ocean. At midnight, he has watched Aliceville, his upland county town, visited like a disturbing Bible vision by electric light. On the porch of a moonshiner's shack, he has pressed his nose to a rusted screen, scratched it with his finger and seen his young father rise like river mist in the breath of the dying man inside. And at the center of his family circle, Jim's childhood has the buoyant weight of love. North Carolina country is Jim's natural sense of place and the haunt of his understanding of the importance of home. It is the other large character in the book. ''I think it's just a family thing,'' said Mr. Earley, whose family, ''both sides,'' have lived for generations within a five-mile radius in a corner of western North Carolina. ''When every one of your ancestors has been looking at the same landscape for 200 years, it becomes rooted like family, passed on, maybe even genetic.'' That kind of orientation -- which closes the book as Jim sights Aliceville from the top of a mountain, and realizes that only home has the power to hold the great world's center -- is being lost, Mr. Earley fears. ''I notice it in the accents of students,'' he said, ''particularly female students. They have the same accent, no matter what part of the country they're from -- a sort of a Valley Girl, television accent. They sound alike.'' Now, he has his own branch of the family, living in Nashville with Ms. Earley, a former seminary student, and their two Jack Russell terriers, Jubal and Rastus. ''She's the C.E.O. of the family,'' Mr. Earley said of his wife as he stood in her office. ''I'm production and she's management.'' On the mantel was a map of North Carolina. Behind a rocking chair hung three quilts, made by his grandmothers. ''Not fancy quilts,'' he said. ''Just everyday quilts.'' The house is furnished with modest, friendly-looking pieces from a previous era, which the Earleys bought cheaply as a young married couple for their first home. ''We were just broke,'' he said. ''We lived in a depressed little steel town outside of Pittsburgh. Because it was so depressed, we managed to buy and renovate a house. All of our furniture we bought at used furniture stores in the Ohio River Valley in these other little depressed steel towns strung out along the river. I had a route I drove every Saturday looking for nice furniture that was cheap. Because we got it with smoke and mirrors, I'm attached to it.'' As a storyteller, Mr. Earley also has a sympathy with the sincerity and drollness of folk art. ''I have a slight weakness for folk art,'' he said. ''Sarah manages to keep it under control. I'd have paintings on plywood all over the house if it were left up to me.'' In the kitchen is a copy of a Cezanne still life. ''It's by a guy we found in Florida who was so excited we were interested in his pictures he gave us three,'' Mr. Earley said. ''His pictures were hanging in a filling station. They'd been there four years and nobody had ever even asked about them.'' Ms. Earley pointed out that the back line of a table in the picture is untrue, shifting planes behind the globes of fruit. ''I thought that was just his mistake, but in the Cezanne, it's not even across, either,'' she said. ''It's an accurate copy -- the colors are just completely different.'' On a bookcase in the vestibule is a wood Madonna nursing a child, carved with a chain saw by a sculptor in Mr. Earley's home county. ''Baptists wandered up into the yard and gave him hard time about a nursing Madonna,'' Mr. Earley recalled. '' 'Well, Jesus had to eat didn't he?' he said to them.'' In the Earleys' bedroom is a hand-lettered sign set on the lintel of a closet. The sign is naive but not art. ''EVERY DAY I WRITE THE BOOK,'' it says. Below it is a pad of large papers with fierce red numbers drawn on them, tacked to the doorjamb like the marks a child makes to measure his height. They are the numbers of the chapters in ''Jim the Boy'' -- a lottery that Mr. Earley fought not to lose for six years. ''The better I get, the more I feel like I have to lose,'' he said. ''I don't want to give any ground back. I haven't always been where I am now. I don't want to go back to where I was. I don't want to have to climb this hill again.'' As with the terrain of ''Jim the Boy,'' familiarity can vanish with each new view. ''It's too big,'' says Jim, seeing his world from the mountain, faltering briefly as an adult. Mr. Earley, who says he wishes to write ''The Complete Jim Glass,'' intends to let him grow into it. AT HOME WITH/TONY EARLEY\",\n",

              " \"Ron Low said yesterday that he is ''a firm believer in not looking at the past.'' And yet, many of the themes that ran through Low's introductory news conference as the 30th head coach in Rangers history hark back to the disaster of last season. Low stressed the need for an attitude change on a team that has failed to make the playoffs in each of the last three springs. ''It's imperative that there is an adjustment,'' said Low, who will be welcoming back Mark Messier to the club today at a morning news conference. The team announced last night that it had reached agreement with the free-agent center, who reportedly got a two-year deal worth $8 million. ''I don't expect it to be easy,'' Low said of his task ahead. ''But I also think the people that are here can get it done.'' He was referring to his two new assistants, Ted Green and Walt Kyle. He was also referring to Glen Sather, the Rangers' president and general manager, who hired him. All four men worked together at Edmonton. Yesterday all four stressed the same themes -- familiarity, loyalty, the ability to communicate, being on the same page -- that were absent on the Rangers last season. Singling out the Rangers' work ethic, Low said: ''Obviously, it wasn't good last year. It couldn't have been good. There were too many underachievers.'' Said Sather: ''Even the cabdrivers have told me that. I've stayed in a couple of different hotels and the bellmen have told me that.'' Sather, who was not able to hire either Kevin Lowe or Craig MacTavish for the top job -- turned to another person with Oiler roots. ''The thinking was that we wouldn't have to go through a honeymoon together,'' Sather said, explaining his selection of Low, who was Sather's head coach in Edmonton for four-plus seasons. ''We know each other.'' That said, Sather laid down his first mandate since becoming team president and general manager on June 1. ''It is not acceptable for this team not to make the playoffs,'' Sather said. Low was asked if that put pressure on him. ''I'm sure it does,'' he said. ''This game comes with a lot of pressure.'' Low was asked if he felt added pressure by having the reigning Stanley Cup champion Devils across the Hudson River. ''Absolutely none,'' Low said, before referring to the Islanders. ''The team the other way is vastly improved, too.'' Low said he would like the Rangers to play the up-tempo style that became synonymous with Edmonton. He also made a distinction between the Oilers and this Rangers team. The former was built on youth and speed. The latter is laden with older, skilled players. ''That's not the same type of team,'' said Low, who was coach and general manager of the Houston Aeros of the International Hockey League last season. ''I understand that totally. Can you play the same way? I think you can. But if you can't, I'm very comfortable with backing up. I trapped last year in Houston. We will look at the situation here and judge ourselves accordingly.'' Low also promised not to judge the Rangers on last season's fiasco. ''I don't think all those guys they signed last year are over the hill or finished,'' Low said. ''There had to be problems last year. We have to find out what they were and solve them.'' The Rangers are obviously hoping that Messier, the former captain who led the team to a Stanley Cup in 1994, will be one of the solutions. The team has not been in the playoffs since his departure in 1997. ''What Mark brings to the table is incredible leadership,'' Low said before the Messier agreement was announced. ''People rally around him. He'd be a great guy to coach.'' Many around the league believe that Messier could be a strong influence on Pavel Brendl, Jamie Lundmark and Manny Malhotra. Sather was asked yesterday if there would be spots for the team's young players. ''Absolutely,'' he said. ''I'm trying to make some changes in the organization. With the set-up of this hockey team, some of those changes are going to take time. But the plan is to make some changes. We're not going to force-feed somebody on the team who's not ready. They're going to have to make the hockey club, just like all the veterans.'' Low, who said he wanted to look at everyone, mentioned Mike York, the Rangers' top rookie last season, as someone he wants to see firsthand. ''I know Brendl is an unbelievable goal scorer,'' Low said. ''It would be nice if he's ready, but I definitely wouldn't put any pressure on him. Lundmark definitely excites you, also. Malhotra, I don't know enough about. But I know one thing about him: he can skate, which likely puts him in my plans. I don't know exactly where he fits. But I like people who can skate.'' Low is being reunited with Sather one year after leaving Edmonton in a contract dispute. ''It might have been a little silly pride,'' Low said. ''The fact that I thought I deserved a raise after getting the team into the playoffs and then knocking off heavily favored opponents twice in a row. I didn't want to be the lowest-paid coach in the league anymore. So I left. And I put my family into a tenuous position there for a while. But now, I'm not regretting the decision at all.'' He signed a deal believed to be for three years at about $700,000 a season. ''Obviously, I'm not coming in with a blindfold on,'' Low said. ''I may leave with a blindfold on. Just give me a smoke.'' SLAP SHOTS The Rangers' president and general manager, GLEN SATHER, admitted having an interest in signing CLAUDE LEMIEUX, who will be 35 when the season starts. ''Will I give him a four-year deal?'' Sather asked. ''No.'' . . . RON LOW on THEO FLEURY, the Rangers' biggest disappointment last season: ''He definitely wasn't the player I'd seen out West the last eight or nine years.

              " \"DOORS and walls made of light-reflecting marble can be weighty, both in pounds and dollars. While the 3/4-inch marble used to face the loft's 450-pound wood and steel doors is $10 a square foot when unfinished, when cut, polished and installed, it costs as much as $100 a square foot. The cost of those doors plus the etched-glass bedroom door and the 60-foot-long wall, including marble, steel support and frame, clerestory and recessed lighting, was around $90,000, or about $1,500 a linear foot, said Derek Huntington, whose company, ZZZ Carpentry, built and installed them. Jeremy Lebensohn, in Brooklyn, fabricated the steel. There is, however, a less expensive way to build a similar wall. Mojdeh Baratloo, of Baratloo-Balch Architects, the firm that designed the loft, said that Venetian plaster comes close to marble in terms of reflecting light and can be applied on top of drywall, which weighs and costs relatively little. Venetian plaster begins with a layer or two of ordinary plaster and finishes with a mix of plaster, wax and tints. A craftsman might charge $15 to $20 a square foot to create a 3/4-inch wall of Venetian plaster, Mr. Huntington said. The drywall and installation would be extra.

              " \"THE Yankees made a contingency trade for Juan Gonzalez. They needed a pitcher. The Yankees tried to make a trade for Sammy Sosa. They needed a pitcher. The Yankees traded for David Justice. They needed a pitcher. The Yankees yesterday traded for Denny Neagle. He is a pitcher. Fortunately for the Yankees, they did not allow George Steinbrenner's wide-eyed desire for a big-name big hitter to prompt them to clean their shelves of minor league and other prospects. Instead of sending them in a package to Detroit for Gonzalez or to the Cubs for Sosa, they delivered some prospects to Cleveland for Justice, a creditable run producer, and others to Cincinnati for Neagle, the best starting pitcher available in the weeks leading up to the July 31 nonwaiver trading deadline. The Neagle acquisition was costly in prospects, but it was and will be costly economically, too. The Yankees' timing, in fact, is impeccable. Bud Selig, the commissioner with the payroll disparity problem, has summoned the owners to New York for a meeting tomorrow. There they will receive the report from a committee assigned the task of figuring out how to solve baseball's economic imbalance. The Yankees are Exhibit A of a team that spends money with no concern for the ramifications their expenditures have for their poorer relatives. Maybe that's the way it should be. The Yankees, after all, are engaged in a free-market, free-enterprise pursuit. Steinbrenner is out to win championships and make money. If spending a few extra million here or there produces a pennant and an invitation to the October dance, by all means spend the money. With the addition of Neagle and his $4.75 million salary, the Yankees' payroll, which passed the unprecedented $100 million milestone when Justice arrived, climbs still higher to about $107 million. But that's not the only economic element at work here. Two of the four minor leaguers the Yankees gave the Reds are Jackson Melian and Drew Henson. When Melian was a 16-year-old Venezuelan in 1996, the Yankees got him with a then-unprecedented $1.6 million signing bonus. When they drafted Henson two years ago, they bought a share of his future sports plans for a $2 million signing bonus. Henson was a top-notch high school quarterback who intended to play football in college. The Yankees made it worth his while to leave his options open and play baseball in the summer before playing football in the fall. Had they retained Henson and he had opted for the N.F.L., they would have eaten the $2 million and not suffered indigestion. But the Yankees have now taken that $3.6 million investment in Melian and Henson and used it to secure a pitcher who could put his left arm in their pitching dike and stem the tide that threatens to sweep them away from their October goal. And, of course, the Yankees don't want Neagle to work for them only for the rest of the season. With his free agency looming after the season, they will want to sign him -- and he's eager to accommodate them -- to a contract extension to keep him around. How would $9 million a year sound? The numbers that follow the dollar signs add to a big, big total. With the Yankees, it doesn't stop. The printing press in the basement at Yankee Stadium keeps pouring out the cash. If the secretaries and the executives think they have it tough having to be at their desks on time and not leaving a minute early in case the owner calls, what about those little old men running the money machine? They're not allowed to leave. Other teams find the playing surface uneven because the Yankees can afford to make mistakes, and most of them can't. Out in the international arena, the Yankees have signed Melian, Alfonso Soriano, Ricardo Aramboles, Hideki Irabu, Orlando Hernandez, Wily Mo Pena and Adrian Hernandez. If one or two of those remaining players and others fail to make it, the Yankees will balance the lost bonus against profits, shrug it off and pursue another unproven Latin or Asian kid. Most other teams feel they have to be more protective of their bonus money. They have to reduce the hit-or-miss ratio to as tiny a number as possible before committing a few million here or there. Who else last year would have given Pena, then a 17-year-old Dominican outfielder, $2.4 million to sign? The commissioner usually cringes when the Yankees make yet another move involving money (they all do, don't they?). Maybe this move, though, he will welcome, considering the timing. Maybe Selig can use this one, letting it incense the other owners to the point that it induces them to accept some radical form of revenue sharing the blue-ribbon task force might propose, Steinbrenner be damned.\",\n",

              " \"Ella Gooden received so many congratulatory phone calls about her son's return to the Yankees that she felt as if Dwight had pitched another no-hitter. Gooden had so many people plant their palms on his back after his five innings against the Mets last Saturday that he wondered if it was a dream. Had he ever left the Yankees? Could his comeback be this smooth? The answers came rushing forward before lunch yesterday when Gooden found out that the Yankees had acquired Denny Neagle from the Cincinnati Reds for four minor leaguers. Neagle's arrival surely signals that Gooden will be removed from the rotation, his improbable and inspirational story fading after five days. Five measly days. Gooden defeated his former team at Shea Stadium and gave the Yankees a surprising jolt, but he was given a jolt of another sort yesterday as his role drastically changed and his next start vanished. But Gooden refused to view it as a demotion. He is more humble after being discarded by two other teams this season, which is a smart strategy if he wants to continue surviving. ''I think it was a good move,'' Gooden said of the deal for Neagle. ''He's shown that he's still a good pitcher since he came back from that injury. When you can bring in another left-hander, you do it.'' Then Gooden laughed into the phone and said, ''What that means for me, I have no idea.'' Gooden's laugh was a curious laugh, not a nervous laugh. Less than a week from that splendid day in Flushing, his old playground, Gooden knows that he is a 35-year-old pitcher with question marks who is trying to hang on as desperately as any of the tribe members trying to win $1 million on ''Survivor.'' If Gooden criticizes Manager Joe Torre, gets into a scuffle with a cab driver or has a horrendous outing, all things he has done, George Steinbrenner, the only person whose vote matters on the Yankees' island, can squash Gooden's career as quickly as he rekindled it. So Gooden should be shrewder now, not bitter. It is the best way for him to act. It seemed unlikely that he would ever get another shot with the Yankees so he must savor it and seize it, even if he winds up as a long reliever behind the unsteady David Cone or as an insurance policy. It appears that Gooden will remain in the majors, but the Yankees have the option of returning him to the minor leagues. Before being promoted to pitch against the Mets on Saturday, he agreed contractually to accept a return to the minors. So the bullpen is better than demotion, or retirement. ''Three or four years ago, I would have said: 'I only want to start. I'm out of here and I'm going home,' '' Gooden said. ''But maybe it's time for me to make the change. I feel comfortable starting or relieving. Maybe the bullpen is the thing for me now.'' Gooden is serious. He has appeared in 413 major league games and has relieved only 7 times, but Gooden realizes the bullpen is the way to prolong his 16-year career. Mel Stottlemyre, the Yanks' pitching coach, was very intrigued when he heard Gooden express interest in relieving because Gooden had never uttered something like that to him. But even baseball survivalists must make concessions. The prospect of being a reliever is one reason Gooden is so enamored of the arm manipulation exercises that he does on a robotic machine a few times a week with Al Meilus, a trainer. Meilus said the exercises lengthen the muscles in Gooden's right arm, increase his range of motion and enable him to throw harder and freer. Gooden has already seen results since it takes him 10 minutes to warm up, a reduction from 20 minutes and an important development for a reliever. Two days before Gooden started against the Mets, Meilus said his fastball barely reached 87 miles an hour. But, after an intense session on the robotic machine, Gooden hit 89 and matched Al Leiter's fastball from one day earlier. Gooden claimed his fastball has been as robust as 92. ''My goal,'' Meilus said, ''is to get him to 95.'' It is a bold goal, but the Yankees do not need Gooden to throw 95 m.p.h. bullets. They simply need him to be reliable. The Yankees scrambled so much in June that they started rookies three times in one week. With the stellar Neagle, a possibly rejuvenated Gooden and a healthy Ramiro Mendoza, the Yankees should finally have some depth. Gooden actually referred to 1997 as evidence for why he can thrive in an uncertain role, another interesting sign since he had one relief outing in 20 games and maligned Torre for using him inconsistently. Now Gooden is embracing this insecure position because it is the only one available. Five days. Gooden had five days where he was back in the rotation with the Yankees and in a spot that he never envisioned five weeks ago. Now that Neagle's presence has altered the rotation for the better, Gooden must adjust again if he hopes to survive. ''I want to be a utility pitcher, just like we have utility players,'' Gooden said. ''I'll spot-start; I'll relieve. I'll do anything they want.'' ON BASEBALL\",\n",

              " \"Just before the July 4 recess, a Senate committee approved a bill that, with some crucial adjustments, could provide the framework for the most ambitious environmental restoration project ever undertaken in the country. The stated purpose of the bill is to restore the historic flows of fresh water that once made the Everglades one of the world's most wondrous and biologically diverse ecosystems. It will cost $8 billion over 20 years, shared by the federal government and Florida, and is the product of seven years of work by the Army Corps of Engineers, the environmental community and the Clinton administration. Its success so far in the Senate owes much to the two Florida senators, Connie Mack and Bob Graham. But most of the credit belongs to Bob Smith, a New Hampshire conservative whose stewardship of the bill has put to rest fears that he would not be as sympathetic to the Everglades as John Chafee, the reliable environmentalist who preceded him as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee and who died last year. But the bill is not a sure thing. What it needs now is a timely and powerful legislative push to get it through an uncertain House of Representatives and onto the president's desk before Washington is overwhelmed by the election campaign. To leave the bill until next year would be to commit it to the uncertain hands of a new Congress and, quite possibly, a new administration far less interested in conservation generally and the Everglades specifically than this one. Congress owes the Everglades restitution. More than 50 years ago, after back-to-back hurricanes that put much of South Florida under water, Congress ordered the Army Corps to drain a half-million acres south of Lake Okeechobee with a web of levees, canals and pumping stations. The result was to keep Florida's booming east coast free from floods and safe for development, and to create conditions under which the sugar cane industry could flourish. But it robbed the Everglades and Florida Bay of their traditional sources of fresh water, and nearly killed both. The Clinton administration, with the Senate's help, wants to set things right by recapturing and rerouting most of the 1.7 billion gallons of water that are wastefully flushed out to sea every day in the name of flood control. The bill specifically authorizes over $1 billion for the first 10 of 68 planned projects. Much of this money would be used to construct massive reservoirs to store Florida's copious rainwater that, at least in theory, will be delivered to the natural system through a redesigned network of canals and levees. The bill needs clarification. From the beginning, the state and the administration have quarreled over who should get most of the newly captured water -- the natural system, Florida's exploding cities, or agriculture. The administration has argued that nature, having been shortchanged for half a century, deserves top billing -- otherwise, why embark on this project at all? Florida, where the developers, the water utilities and sugar interests have great political power, has insisted on doing what it wants to. The bill says at one point that restoration is its ''overarching purpose.'' Elsewhere, however, it gives urban and agricultural needs equal weight. This is first and foremost a restoration bill, not a water supply bill for the cities and farms, and any ambiguities on this point must be cleared up. The bill should also provide a greater oversight role over the life of the project for the Interior Department, which manages about half the land to be restored. While making these fixes, the bill's supporters must also focus on building political momentum in the House, where opponents will try to create mischief. One person who could help move things forward is Jeb Bush, Florida's governor. He has promised $200 million, Florida's share of the project's first-year costs. But he has not shown the enthusiasm of his predecessor, Lawton Chiles, who courageously blocked efforts by the agricultural interests to exercise line-by-line veto power over the project through their friends in the state legislature. A more vigorous public commitment on his part would be welcome and might have real influence in the House. At risk is an irreplaceable natural asset that happens to be dying.\",\n",

              " \"The operators of Co-op City, the sprawling apartment development in the Bronx that is home to 60,000 mostly black and Hispanic residents, are being sued by 50 employees and residents who say they faced racial discrimination in the workplace and in the sales office of the complex. In the suit, which the plaintiffs plan to file this morning in State Supreme Court in the Bronx, the employees charge that they faced crude racial harassment at the hands of white co-workers and were denied promotions based on their race. The workers and tenants, all but one of whom are black or Hispanic, also say prospective black residents were steered into less desirable buildings, with preference given to whites. The suit names as defendants the Riverbay Corporation, Co-op City's owner; Marion Scott Real Estate Company, the development's private manager; and Steve Gold, the sales manager. Parts of the suit were provided yesterday to The New York Times. Jeffrey K. Brown, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the development's owners had ''systematically repressed minorities.'' ''They've done it through various mechanisms,'' he said. ''One is denial of advancements. Two is disparate treatment and three is a racially hostile and intimidating environment, where people are called the 'N' word, where people have feces smeared on their vehicles, where people are told not to place African-Americans and minorities in certain housing sections.'' The accusations were aggressively denounced by Marion Scott, president of Marion Scott Real Estate, which last year became the first private company to run Co-op City since the 1968 construction of its 35 towers, schools and retail centers in the northeast Bronx. Mr. Scott, who is African-American, called the claims ludicrous given that two-thirds of Co-op City's 925 employees and more than 70 percent of residents are black or Hispanic. He said he was incensed at charges that prospective black residents were steered toward ''black'' buildings or that their applications were shredded. He said state oversight of Co-op City prevents such bias. He also said creating hurdles for prospective minority residents would have been economically foolhardy, especially because the development had about 700 vacancies during the time that the plaintiffs are alleging the wrongdoing. ''We have outside bouncers throwing people in here, not throwing people out,'' he said. ''We were looking for anyone who had the money and the qualifications to apply.'' Mr. Scott also accused the Long Island law firm filing the suit, Leeds, Morelli & Brown, of being ''stick-up artists.'' He said the firm was trying to extort money from Co-op City with a frivolous case. Last week, Riverbay's lawyers filed a complaint with the New York State Grievance Committee of the 10th Judicial District, accusing Leeds, Morelli & Brown of trying to force Riverbay to pay $7.5 million in fees to pay for mediation to resolve the complaints and forgo litigation. Several plaintiffs remained adamant about their charges yesterday. Jaime Paredes, 57, said he kept running into obstacles when he tried to buy a two-bedroom apartment in a desirable area. He was rejected last September, he said. ''They're looking to put a white family in that apartment, not a Hispanic, and I'm a Hispanic,'' Mr. Paredes said. Brenda Brown, 48, a former Riverbay office worker and resident of Co-op City who is black, said she put up with racial taunts and watched white office workers make it difficult for blacks to move into Co-op City. Ms. Brown also said she was passed up for promotions. ''It's hostile,'' she said, ''when your face is black and you see injustices done.'' But Mr. Scott said Ms. Brown was fired in June 1999 after she was caught on videotape punching the time cards of fellow workers hours after the workers had finished their shift. As for Mr. Paredes's claims, Mr. Scott said people who are rejected often complain to regulators, though most claims are unfounded. ''If you look at the demographics of the young people who've rented, they're mostly black and Hispanics,'' Mr. Scott said. ''He might have been turned down for other reasons.''\",\n",
              " \"The bishops of the Episcopal Church, acting on the most contentious issue facing their denomination's General Convention, voted late today to reject a proposal that church officials develop rites to bless relationships between couples living together outside marriage, rituals that would probably be particularly applied to gay relationships. The vote, with 85 bishops against the proposal and 63 supporting it, came after more than three hours of debate, during which several of the prelates gathered here warned that were the proposal to pass, it could threaten the unity of the 2.4 million-member denomination, so severe are divisions among Episcopalians over what recognition to extend to gay and lesbian parishioners. Bishop Ed Little of the Diocese of Northern Indiana said he did not support the proposal ''because it will deepen our divisions.'' But another prelate, Catherine Roskam, a suffragan or auxiliary bishop of New York, called for supporting the development of the rites, saying, ''We have been pioneers in the ordination of women and we can be pioneers in this.'' The bishops' vote was the second time in two days that church leaders have rejected the proposal that an Episcopalian commission develop rites to be considered and voted upon at the next convention, which will be held in 2003. The convention, held every three years, is the church's top policy-making body, divided into two separate chambers, one composed of bishops, the other of clergy and lay people who are called ''deputies.'' On Tuesday, at the meeting at the Denver Convention Center, the House of Deputies voted against the proposal, but by a narrow margin. The proposal for the rites originally appeared as the eighth paragraph in an unusual resolution on sexuality that has been under consideration at the convention. After the deputies deleted that controversial paragraph, they overwhelmingly approved the resolution and sent it on to the bishops to consider. The resolution states that the church officially acknowledges that among the people in its pews are unmarried couples living in long-term relationships. It adds that although such relationships depart from traditional Christian teaching on sexuality, the church should give the couples involved its pastoral care and ''prayerful support.'' The statement makes no distinction between heterosexual and homosexual relationships -- and so implicitly includes both. The bishops have yet to vote on the resolution itself, although in their debate many expressed support for it, without the controversial eighth paragraph. The resolution is a carefully nuanced document, deploring promiscuity, declaring that Episcopalian leaders ''expect'' that nonmarital relationships will be monogamous and also noting that the church teaches that marriage is sanctified. The bishops' vote today centered on whether to amend the resolution to re-attach the eighth paragraph that the House of Deputies had rejected. Had that passed, the question would have been placed again before the House of Deputies, which could either re-affirm its earlier vote or change it. When they reconvene on Thursday, the bishops will consider another amendment to the resolution on whether a church commission should try in the next three years to find out whether it is possible to develop a theological basis for the blessing of relationships outside marriage. The broader question of how far a church should go in recognizing gay relationships is highly controversial among Episcopalians and many other Protestant denominations. Two weeks ago, the top policy-making body of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) passed an amendment to its constitution that would prohibit ministers from officiating at same-sex unions. The amendment must ratified by a two-thirds majority of the church's regional jurisdictions within the next year if it is to become law.\",\n",

              " \"In a historic first, the New Hampshire House of Representatives impeached the chief justice of the State Supreme Court today, accusing him of four ethical lapses and handing his fate over to the State Senate for trial. The 253-to-95 vote on Chief Justice David A. Brock culminated weeks of constitutional agony in New Hampshire, triggered by a nasty divorce. The divorce of one of the five Supreme Court justices led to an inquiry by the state attorney general into the court's practices, which led lawmakers to examine whether there were grounds for impeachment. Repeatedly today, House members decided that there were grounds to impeach Chief Justice Brock, though they spared two of his Supreme Court colleagues, Justices Sherman Horton and John Broderick. The House had last impeached a Supreme Court justice in 1790, and it had never before impeached a chief justice. The Republican-dominated House, by roughly 2 to 1, not particularly along party lines, approved four articles of impeachment against Chief Justice Brock, 64. They accused him of making a phone call to a Superior Court judge 13 years ago seeking to influence a case; of allowing the divorcing justice to influence the appointment of judges in his own case; of allowing judges to comment on cases from which they had recused themselves, and of repeatedly lying under oath. ''This investigation, if it accomplishes nothing else, has lifted the skirt of Lady Justice and taken a peek,'' said Henry P. Mock, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which recommended the impeachment. ''Did we see anything there that was really, really naughty? Not too bad, but we have seen things that were absolutely wrong. Not only that, but her blindfold slipped. Justice is blind, but she took a peek and she wasn't supposed to.'' Chief Justice Brock, who was not present today, has acknowledged that he made errors of judgment. But one of his lawyers, David Barry, said the chief justice contended that they were not impeachable conduct, and that he looked forward to the opportunity to clear his name. The House vote ''will be viewed as a historic aberration,'' Mr. Barry said, and possibly a dangerous one because ''it has lowered the impeachment bar and put at risk the independence of the judiciary.'' The Senate, advised by a former United States senator, George Mitchell, is expected to begin the trial next month, and even advocates of today's impeachment are predicting that Chief Justice Brock is likely to prevail there. ''They'll clean our clocks in the Senate,'' said Representative Tony F. Soltani, a Republican, pointing out that the Senate tends to be more sympathetic to the judiciary than the 400-seat House. Indeed, some opponents of impeachment today complained in the House hallways that they believed the impeachment was based not on the facts but on festering anger against the State Supreme Court for its 1997 ''Claremont'' decision requiring the state to revamp its heavily local system for financing schools. The state is still struggling to work out a new system. ''I think, because Brock was a substantial influence in getting the Claremont decision passed, that this was in part a great backlash against him,'' said Beth Rodd, Democrat of Bradford and formerly of Brooklyn. ''I don't feel that justice is being done. I feel there's a vindictive spirit, a mob mentality has taken over.'' But advocates of the impeachment said it was necessary to restore public confidence in the court. The divorcing justice, W. Stephen Thayer III, could influence the selection of judges for his divorce, while his wife could not, Mr. Soltani commented, and that ''is repulsive to me, repulsive beyond belief.'' Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, said today that she was committed to doing all she could to restore confidence in the courts, including pushing a constitutional amendment providing that judges be appointed for set terms rather than for life. The New Hampshire standards for impeachment are lower than the federal standards that became familiar to many during President Clinton's impeachment proceedings. It is enough, under New Hampshire law, for a judge to commit no ''high crime or misdemeanor'' but merely ''maladministration'' -- a word that lawmakers seemed to have trouble defining today. Some argued that since it was listed together with bribery and corruption, it must involve malice and ill-intent. Many speakers said today that the chief justice's main error had been one of compassion, in that he had felt sorry for Justice Thayer, and tried to help him. ''Are we going to hang a man for compassion?'' demanded one lawmaker, Richard Kennedy. But advocates of impeachment depicted the chief justice's misdeeds as too serious to be overlooked. He was accused of making a phone call in 1987 to a Superior Court judge who was hearing a contract dispute, and reminding him that one of the litigants was a powerful senator who could influence judicial pay increases. Chief Justice Brock has denied making such a call. He was also accused of committing ''maladministration'' in February when he informed Justice Thayer which judges he would appoint to a special panel needed to hear the Thayer divorce case because the Supreme Court justices had all recused themselves. When Chief Justice Brock made that announcement, witnesses said, Justice Thayer objected to one of the judges, and Chief Justice Brock tried to hold back the court clerk from calling that judge. Thus far, Chief Justice Brock has had little chance to mount his own defense. But his day will come in the Senate, Mr. Barry said. ''The citizens of New Hampshire should make no mistake,'' he said, ''this man has been on trial for three months now, and he's had no due process, no rights and no voice. This 'jury' that convicted him today has acted as a result of a one-sided process.''\",\n",
              " \"LAST year Lance Armstrong, of Austin, Tex., won the grueling Tour de France bicycle race after recovering from a brush with death from testicular cancer. Despite the attention Mr. Armstrong received, the United States remains one of the few places on earth where cycling fans can't get live television broadcasts of all 21 races that make up the Tour this year. That may be just as well. The time difference between here and France means that depending on where you are, catching an entire daily stage of the three-week Tour live would mean losing sleep or skipping work. But for cycling fans, temptation lurks in the form of the World Wide Web. Although it doesn't offer live video of cycling's most important race, at least one site has live audio in English and many others offer up-to-the-minute text reports. For those patient enough to wait until the action is over each day, the best Web sites for the race shame traditional American media in terms of the completeness of their information. The Societe du Tour de France was one of cycling's first governing bodies to use the Web. It remains the master. The most prominent feature of the site (www.letour.fr/2000/us) is a stream of text reports updating the race while it is underway. The updates are largely based on reports from spotters in cars and on motorcycles who travel close to the action. Known as Radio Tour, this system is the main source of information for nearly everyone following the race. Details of the route, a three-dimensional view of the mountains and, of course, every result and race statistic are available on the site. Elaborate graphics sometimes slow downloads. A new feature allows Web spectators to share an experience formerly limited to the press corps: the daily post-race news conferences. Now the whole world can watch the goings-on through Webcasts, which are sometimes translated into English. Web visitors can't ask questions, and when they see how stilted and artificial the news conferences generally are, they may be thankful. This portion of the site promises that visitors will ''experience it like you were there.'' Unfortunately, it follows through. A particular page on the French language part of the site is worth visiting even for those who can't read a word in the language. It is a photo gallery depicting parts of the publicity caravan, a shamelessly commercial parade of often bizarre vehicles (www.letour.fr/caravane /fr). It precedes the riders by about one hour and tries to amuse one of the world's largest live, captive audiences with noise, loud music and, above all, attractive young men and women who toss out trinkets, free product samples and empty shopping bags to hold all the junk. VeloNews is the only United States-based magazine devoted to bicycle racing, as opposed to training or equipment. This year the magazine has expanded its Tour de France coverage on the Web (www.greatoutdoors.com/velonews /race/road/00tdf). The experience of the magazine staff -- the editorial director, John Wilcockson, has followed the Tour for 32 years -- is apparent in its full race reports. Unfortunately several hours sometimes pass between the end of racing and their appearance. The site also offers the same updated race reports found at the official Tour de France site. Not all VeloNews journalists are professional writers. Three American professional riders in the race -- Tyler Hamilton, a teammate of Mr. Armstrong; Fred Rodriguez; and Chann McRae -- take turns producing a behind-the-scenes diary for the site. Mr. Hamilton, the most successful cyclist of the trio, is also the most promising writer. Although no one offers streaming video of the live race, Eurosport (tour2000.eurosport.com/home.asp ?LangueID=2) at least has a poor man's substitute. While the race is in progress, the satellite sports channel gives a streaming feed of the audio portion of its broadcasts. To reach it, users click on a button marked Radio Tour. Its English language television broadcast is mainly viewed in the United Kingdom, so the coverage pays particular -- sometimes excessive -- attention to riders from that country. Of course, TV without pictures has limitations. The early and ultimately meaningless portions of nonstrategic stages seem even more tedious without views of the attractive French countryside to pass the time. When something does happen, it can be frustrating to listen to Eurosport's announcers pick apart something from an invisible video replay. But this is as close to a live broadcast as Americans can get. The expert commentary on many stages is provided by Sean Kelly, a retired Irish rider who was once a leading Tour sprinter. Unfortunately, one famous (and very plausible) cycling legend is that the taciturn Mr. Kelly once shook his head to answer yes or no during a radio interview. A small daily video highlight package is also available. Its viewers might first want to turn their speakers off. The soundtrack is always a jarring mix of screams from the crowd and European disco music. The Web site of Lance Armstrong's United States Postal Service cycling team (www.uspsprocycling .com) offers two daily race reports. One is written by a team official, the other by a public affairs person from the sponsor. Neither is among the best reports available on the Web, but the site does have some interesting features, like the detailed description of a team bike by one of the team's mechanic, Geoff Brown, who also offers an essay on the mechanic's role in racing. There is also an excerpt from Mr. Armstrong's autobiography. Far more elaborate is Nike's Tour site, which is reached through the company's home page (www.nike .com), a sponsor of Mr. Armstrong and the supplier of his team's clothing. In addition to the usual daily stage reports, which focus mostly on Mr. Armstrong's analysis, the site has a number of video and multimedia features. That means that downloads can be taxing at dial-up modem speeds. The Tour de France began in 1903 as a publicity gimmick for the newspaper L'Auto, a predecessor of L'Equipe, a daily sports newspaper based in Paris. The yellow leader's jersey that Mr. Armstrong hopes to wear into Paris on July 23 is colored to match the paper on which both newspapers were once printed. The race and the newspaper are operated separately today but are part of the same corporate group. And no organization in the world covers the Tour as thoroughly as L'Equipe. For all the race participants, including the riders, it is the final word on the Tour. Unfortunately the newspaper's site (www.lequipe.fr) is costly by Web standards. Once users register by setting up an awkward online debit account, they can spend 1 Euro (about 95 cents) to buy the right to view a specific issue of the paper electronically for up to seven days. Dealing with L'Equipe's awkward online purchasing process is the least of most people's problems, because the site is written in French. But for cycling fans who read French or have a willing human translator or a reliable electronic one, there is no more complete Tour source. SCREEN GRAB\",\n",

              " \"SCAPEGOAT The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation By Andrea Dworkin 436 pages. The Free Press. $28. During the course of her new book, ''Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation,'' Andrea Dworkin makes some extraordinary remarks aimed at bringing home her main point: that hatred of Jews and hatred of women are two closely related consequences of a similar thirst to dominate the weak. She quotes from a 1995 book on Arab women, for example, asserting that the Israeli Army ''may be the only one in the world'' whose members routinely ''sexually expose themselves'' as ''a means to disperse Arab women demonstrators or groups of women.'' Then, in a passage on the supposed subordination of women in Judaism, she cites a rabbinical interpretation of adultery that, according to Ms. Dworkin, allows men to be unfaithful to their wives. One result of this theological ruse, she writes, is that ''Orthodox Jews, post-Holocaust and in Israel, are major users of prostitutes.'' It is statements like these -- and there are numerous others in Ms. Dworkin's new book -- that illustrate the intemperate, extremist and intellectually seedy side to a book that in other respects is a learned and thought-provoking etiology of hatred through history. You don't have to be an avid supporter of Israel to feel a surge of skepticism over that report of routine exposure as a crowd-control method. Ms. Dworkin, however, ever ready to believe the worst about male behavior, accepts it and reproduces it without any visible attempt at verification. As for the frequency with which Israeli Orthodox men visit prostitutes, one is naturally led to ask how Ms. Dworkin would know that. She gives no source at all for this information, though her book is generally heavily footnoted. There are, in short, many problems with this passionate, overburdened and overwrought book, not the least of them that it is more an angry rant than a cogent, careful argument. Ms. Dworkin's main point is that the oppression both of women and of Jews through history, of which there has certainly been a horrifyingly large amount, reflects a kind of sexualized violence, a will to dominate. In this sense, she argues, the Jews have been turned into women by those who wanted to dominate them, the women into Jews. Or, as Ms. Dworkin puts it: ''Contempt for Jews is warranted because contempt for women is normative; both Jews and women have been locked in at night, Jews in ghettos, women in houses. Because, like women, Jews have not fought back, the men are taken to be biologically deviant in having none of the violent pride that distinguishes men from women.'' Leaving aside that subtly insinuated notion that violent pride is a universal male characteristic, there is certainly something to that argument, which Ms. Dworkin substantiates in a wide-ranging ramble through the rich history of human cruelty and depravity. She writes with stylistic eloquence and command, and she has read widely. Her new book is full of gripping passages on Nazi behavior, which Ms. Dworkin rightly sees as an apex of sexualized human cruelty, and she distills many of her ideas into pithy aphorisms: ''Every one of these rapists is a Nazi; and every one of the raped is a Jew: which is to say that rape is a manifestation of sexual fascism, the woman the scapegoated victim.'' Still, ''Scapegoat'' makes you think of one of those arcade games in which enemies are always appearing out of the scenery and you have to blow them away quickly, before you have a good chance to see exactly who they are, and Ms. Dworkin sees many enemies. Her overall conviction is that a sexualized will to dominate is a historical constant, one that women will escape only when they hold ultimate political power: ''Women either are the state or women are resubordinated.'' In this sense ''Scapegoat'' continues the themes already developed in past work by Ms. Dworkin, who has written many books on violence against women. Her comment about Orthodox men and prostitutes is part of a larger thesis developed in ''Scapegoat'': Israelis have overcompensated for the historical weakness of European Jews, their womanlike character of passivity in the face of oppression, by becoming macho dominators themselves, of women and of Palestinians, whose manhood has been taken away from them. ''Of course once Jewish men became physical, no longer gentle or weak, they had to own Jewish women in a new roughhouse sort of way,'' she writes. And then: ''In male culture the nature of women is simply a movable feast from whip wielder to abject victim; but both justify eventual male violence.'' But even if one shares Ms. Dworkin's natural horror at the prevalence of violence against women, and at such phenomena as female infanticide in China or the sexual apartheid practiced against women in some Muslim countries, ''Scapegoat'' remains untrustworthy, troubling in its extremism. Ms. Dworkin's book reads like a catalog of infamous things with what often seem to be isolated, or even aberrational instances, generalized to represent an unspeakable whole. Her summary of Jewish theology and practice contains so many half-truths and misinterpretations that it would take another book to refute them all. Suffice it to say that it is not true that 613 of the religious commandments apply to men and only 2 to women, or that women granted divorces by religious courts in Israel are required to exit the scene bowing gratefully to their husbands. Ms. Dworkin's indefatigable quest for the violence of the male culture leads her to range widely. For example, she cites the practice of suttee -- by which widows are burned alive on the funeral pyres of their husbands -- to represent pretty much the whole of the female condition in India. Nowhere does she tell us how widespread this barbaric and illegal practice is, but she does make this rather remarkable declaration: ''In India, women can be murdered with impunity any time in life.'' No reasonable person would declare India to be a feminist paradise, but Ms. Dworkin's unsubstantiated allegations show more of a superheated imagination than assiduous research. The unreliability of her reporting, the very avidity of her quest to prove the absolute inevitability of testosterone-driven violence, transforms ''Scapegoat'' from scholarship to a kind of agitprop and spoils what might otherwise have been a vigorous explanation for the worst in human behavior. BOOKS OF THE TIMES\",\n",
              " \"Drivers have been paying almost twice as much for gasoline at Kenneth Cerny's service station as they did a few years ago, but Mr. Cerny is a poorer man for it. His Cerny's Midway Market sells gas under the Citgo brand in Mukwonago, Wis., where prices soared to over $2 a gallon last month after pipeline problems and new federal clean-fuel rules crimped Midwest supplies. Customers have been furious. ''All they understand is what they see at the gas pump,'' Mr. Cerny said. But the price he pays for his gasoline has risen faster than the price he can charge customers and still stay competitive, he said. For many independent operators, who own most of the country's service stations and convenience stores, rising gas prices have brought little benefit, and in some regions they have actually made it tougher to do business. But elsewhere along the chain that takes oil from the ground to the filling station, higher prices have meant sharply higher profits -- for producers and refiners. Major oil companies are expected to post average earnings growth of 121 percent for the three months ended in June, compared with the period last year, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Exploration and production companies are expected to report average increases of 371 percent. Even refiners, who have suffered through two years of very thin profits, are seeing profits double or triple. With a host of politicians, including Vice President Al Gore, demanding an investigation of ''price gouging,'' the Federal Trade Commission has started an inquiry into possible industry collusion. Why are profits up so sharply? Collusion by OPEC has clearly played a role. The primary reason crude oil prices have risen sharply -- the biggest factor in the leap in gasoline prices -- was the decision by the cartel's ministers in March 1999 to curtail oil production. Despite two production increases this year, and Saudi Arabia's plan to raise output by another 500,000 barrels a day, oil hovers at close to $30 a barrel, almost triple the low prices of early last year. With their costs remaining much the same but the price they're being paid for oil rising sharply, oil producing nations and companies are doing far better. For example, the largest United States oil producers generally see their profits rise about 6 percent for every $1 increase in crude oil prices, according to Bruce Lanni, an industry analyst at CIBC World Markets. An even more drastic turnabout in profits has come in the refining business, the middle step between pumping oil from the ground and pumping gas into cars. Refiners take crude oil and ''crack'' it into refined products, including gas, heating oil and jet fuel. This is done by major integrated oil companies, like Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Tex., as well as by independents, like the Valero Energy Corporation, based in San Antonio, and the Tosco Corporation, based in Stamford, Conn. Before gas prices started their rise last year, drivers reaped the benefits of both low crude prices and slim margins for refiners. For refiners, though, it was a very painful period, as overcapacity and stiff competition cut profits, making last year the worst for the industry in more than a decade, analysts say. Refining ''is just a horrible business,'' said Paul Y. Cheng, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. But this year has brought at least temporary relief to refiners, and that is not simply because of higher oil prices. Refiners profit if the price of gas and heating oil rises faster than the price of crude. That is what happened this year, analysts say, as strong demand and low inventories allowed refiners to sell their product on the spot market at higher and higher prices, which were then passed on to the marketing companies, distributors and wholesalers that deliver gas to the pump. Refiners use the term ''crack spread'' to describe the gap between what it costs them to buy crude oil and the price they get for selling gas and other refined products. As 1999 came to a close, spreads were thin, but a late blast of winter in the Northeast caused demand for heating oil to soar, lifting prices and margins. Spreads improved further during the spring, as it became clear that domestic gas inventories were quite low even as demand for gas was accelerating with the strong economy and the approach of the summer driving season. And they widened even more in May and June as low inventories, supply disruptions and the federally mandated introduction of a new type of reformulated gas caused pump prices to soar, especially in the Midwest. Before, ''you had low crude prices and an oversupply, which led to cutthroat competition and a period of companies trying to liquidate inventories into a market that was oversold,'' said Arthur L. Smith, the chief executive of John S. Herold Inc., an industry researcher. ''That has reversed, and now you have high crude prices to pass through, and you can pass them through because inventories are down.'' Refining margins across the United States averaged $6.64 a barrel in the second quarter, compared with $3.27 in the period last year, according to calculations by Mr. Lanni. In the Midwest, where a pipeline break and a shortage of new reformulated gas caused the worst spike in retail prices, margins averaged $9.45 a barrel for the period -- topping $17 at one point -- compared with $3.18 the year before. Spreads ''this year are better than they have ever been,'' said William E. Greehey, Valero's chief executive. ''We entered the season with low inventories, demand has been strong and distillate inventories are still very low.'' Whether the oil industry is profiting excessively is a matter of debate. President Clinton, for example, has said there is ''no economic explanation'' for the surge in prices, particularly in the Midwest. But industry analysts say the industry is merely doing what many other businesses, from makers of software to makers of sport utility vehicles, are doing: pricing aggressively and opportunistically to maximize profits. Philip K. Verleger, a senior advisor to the Brattle Group, an economic consulting firm, who has served on several federal and state investigations into accusations of oil industry collusion, said past efforts to pin price-fixing charges on the industry had had little success. ''When I served on these things, and every time I talked to F.T.C. economists, nobody can find anything,'' he said. After peaking three weeks ago the price of gas is now falling. Regular gas is now $1.59 a gallon -- both nationally and in the Midwest -- down from $1.68 nationally and $1.87 in the Midwest. Looking ahead, industry officials say that while the recent drop in gas prices had caused refinery spreads to narrow in the last few weeks, a potential shortage in heating oil should keep profits strong during the second half of the year. Analysts say that by October, the nation needs inventories of heating oil and similar distillates of at least 135 million barrels to ensure that prices are somewhat stable during the winter. But inventories are now at 109 million barrels, and with many refiners still focused on capturing the wide spreads from gas, it is not certain that heating oil inventories will reach more normal levels by the time cold weather arrives. And since the price of natural gas has also risen sharply this year, that is expected to add to demand for heating oil. ''The market is so tight right now that any refinery that goes down is going to cause a disruption,'' Mr. Greehey said, ''and if we have any kind of winter, we're going to see people complaining about fuel oil prices like they were complaining about gas prices in the Midwest.'' The recent drop in wholesale gas prices has brought some relief to service station and convenience store owners, but it may be a while before they recover from the whipsawing they suffered in May and June, when wholesale prices soared. In March and early April, many retailers enjoyed widening margins as wholesale prices fell. But that reversed quickly, and their margins contracted severely across much of the nation, especially in the Midwest and West Coast. The average national wholesale price of regular gas leaped 37 cents, to $1.19 a gallon, between April 13 and June 22, according to the Oil Price Information Service, which tracks gas prices. Over the same time, the average retail pump price rose just 15 cents, to $1.65. Owners of service stations say that their business is too competitive to enable them to pass all their price increases to customers immediately. ''On the way up, retail tends to lag, so in a fast-rising market a retailer can get really squeezed,'' said Kevin J. Lindemer, who tracks refining at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''When the market starts to fall, it depends on how aggressive the competition is, you can recover a little bit of that margin, but that's not always the case.'' Service station and convenience store owners have had to contend with other problems. For example, in regions of the nation where station owners shy away from requiring drivers to prepay, the number of ''drive-offs'' has soared, according to industry associations, as customers apparently feel more justified stealing gas. Bill Douglas, who owns nine service stations and runs a gasoline distribution company in Sherman, Tex., has been losing $1,000 a month in drive-offs recently at his largest stations. In at least five states, new laws have gone into effect this year requiring people who repeatedly steal gas to lose their license. And service station owners are being squeezed in other ways: with gas prices so much higher, the value of a typical station's inventory has soared, making it more costly to finance. Many gas credit cards often charge 3 percent of the transaction amount as a fee, so station owners are paying more in credit card fees. ''Everybody that I meet thinks I'm getting rich. They say, 'I bet you're really enjoying these high prices,' '' Mr. Douglas said. ''But cashiers take the brunt of it. They get insulted regularly.''\",\n",
              " \"INTO every dark loft, a lot of light can fall. When Dr. Tilman Friedrich and his wife, Carlota Vollhardt, bought their 2,500-square-foot TriBeCa loft in 1998, they chose it for its location. It was in an 1860 building, once a warehouse for cheese and eggs, on a street graced with a triangular park. Moreover, their favorite restaurants were only a few blocks away. There was, however, just one thing wrong. Like many lofts, apartments and town houses, their loft had windows only at each end (north and south), and darkness in between. But the couple had an idea: a marble wall that would make the light pouring in from the three south-facing windows dance halfway down the loft, from early morning into the afternoon. ''Originally, the idea was a backlit onyx wall,'' said Dr. Friedrich, a cardiologist who works for Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, who added that the idea of the wall came from his friend, Uwe Drapper, an architect in Berlin. ''But I thought onyx walls were like the walls of Chinese restaurants.'' He and his wife, an organizational psychologist, also with Pfizer, prefer a crisp, clean modernist aesthetic. They like their clothes black, their walls white and their chairs by Mies van der Rohe. The loft is partly a pied-a-terre. Dr. Friedrich works in Manhattan, while Ms. Vollhardt commutes between Pfizer offices in New York and Groton, Conn. Although they have a house on Long Island Sound, they are profoundly urban. ''Before Groton, we have always been in cities,'' Dr. Friedrich said. When they were students in Berlin, they lived in an industrial loft, complete with a bar. In TriBeCa, they wanted to replicate the loft and bar, but without the restrictions of a student budget. After all, this is a couple who dine at Chanterelle and Danube on a monthly basis. ''I wanted a marble wall, something quiet but strong,'' Dr. Friedrich said. ''We wanted a large living area because we love to cook.'' He is the kind of weekend chef who makes sauces from stock reductions involving beef bones roasted then simmered for hours on end. Her specialty is pastry. They both love stone, and they wanted it on counters, bar and kitchen floor. And they wanted everything suffused with light. So when they hired Clifton Balch and Mojdeh Baratloo, of Baratloo-Balch Architects in Manhattan, they didn't have a wish list. They had a must-do list. Together, the architects and clients chose a white Alabama marble, whose beautiful veins, in shades of charcoal darkening to black, look like a Chinese brush painting. Mr. Balch took Polaroids of the 23 slabs of 3/4-inch marble and handed them to Dr. Friedrich, who rearranged the Polaroids, as in a game of Solitaire, until he had exactly the effect he wanted. ''We tried the marble two ways, polished and also honed for a matte finish,'' Ms. Baratloo said. ''It's the polished nature that reflects the light and brings out the pattern.'' The steel-framed wall has three flush doors, which open onto two home offices and a bathroom between. Each door -- solid wood, clad in marble and steel -- weighs 450 pounds. The workmanship is so fine that the doors glide open, smoothly and silently. To maximize the light, the architects designed a clerestory above the seven-foot-high, 60-foot-long marble wall, so that sunlight travels along the ceiling. Recessed fluorescent lighting beneath the clerestory makes the ceiling glow at night. The architects also designed a translucent acid-etched glass door for the bedroom at the southern end of the loft. Open or closed, the door allows light to travel down the hall. The couple now inhabit a bright new box inside an old brick shell. ''All the new materials are rich and sleek,'' Ms. Vollhardt said, ''and the old ones are rough.'' Just as the rear of the loft is private, the front is designed to be a place where friends can perch at the granite-covered kitchen counter, perhaps peeling potatoes while their host poaches sea bass. Or they can sit at the 1950's-inspired curvy bar, a collaboration between the architects and the clients. ''Everything is hard-edged, and this is curvilinear,'' Mr. Balch said. To Ms. Vollhardt, the bar is more than a curve tucked into a rectangle. ''It's about playfulness,'' she said. Granite was chosen for bar and countertop because it is tougher than marble, and they found some with a sinuous pattern. The Bulthaup kitchen system, imported from Germany, is so precisely engineered it looks like a NASA space station, with the equally precise Dr. Friedrich at the controls. The kitchen floor is a soapstone whose deep, dusky color was chosen to complement blue-gray lacquer cabinets. Even the fireplace is crisp and pristine. The architects cut rectangles for the hearth and for the firewood, and framed them with more light-reflecting marble. Along with the luxury of light is the warmth of wood, whether it's the larch wood cabinetry, the oak floors or Ms. Vollhardt's family heirlooms. When Ms. Vollhardt's parents traveled through Spain in the 1940's, they bought a a 15th-century table from a priest at a Renaissance church. Today, it is a coffee table in a modern loft in TriBeCa. ''He didn't want to use it anymore,'' Ms. Vollhardt said, ''because it was old.'' HOUSE PROUD\"]"

              "\"LEVENE-Ricky. So dearly loved, so deeply missed, so much too soon. Our constant love. Mom and your family''We wanted a building with a certain exuberance to it,'' said James T. Dowell, executive director of the Riverside Park Fund, about the Volunteer House, left, a light-hearted folly to rise next year above a one-story storage building near 106th Street. Today, it is pink-painted limestone with patches of graffiti (Mike Dottie 4life) underneath a verdigris coating of moss. The group, founded in 1986 to help pull the park's socks up, sees a day when gardening classes and volunteers will flock to this airy space nestled against the cliff below Riverside Drive. The problem has been how to encourage residents to enter the lovely park. The architect Jeffrey Murphy, of Murphy Burnham & Buttrick, who has designed Volunteer House, said, ''It's a commitment to get down there.'' The park drops 45 feet below Riverside Drive to the building, then farther, to a broad promenade, then even farther, to the active sports area along the Henry Hudson Parkway. Recently, volunteers have adopted rambles and gardens, a dog run was built and the Hudson Beach Cafe opened near the new all-weather soccer field, skate park and basketball courts, much of which is the work of the fund. ''For some people, the park is forbidding, but the whole area has seen a resurgence in the last few years,'' Mr. Dowell said. LINDA LEE CURRENTS: ARCHITECTURESmall-business owners and farmers whose Washington lobbyists are ardent backers of a Republican-backed plan to repeal the estate tax seem largely unaware that President Clinton -- who has vowed to veto the Republican proposal -- has said he would sign legislation that would exempt nearly all of them from the tax starting next year. Business owners and farmers would be allowed to leave $2 million -- $4 million for a couple -- to their heirs without paying estate taxes under the plan favored by the President and the Democratic leadership in Congress. The Republican proposal, which passed the House last month with some Democrats' support and is being debated in the Senate this week, would be phased in slowly, with the tax eliminated in 2009. Supporters of the Republican plan say the tax is so complicated that eliminating it is the only effective reform; they argue that the nation's growing wealth means more estates will steadily fall under the tax if it remains law on the Democratic proposal's terms. Still, had the Democratic plan been law in 1997, the last year for which estate tax return data is available from the Internal Revenue Service, the estates of fewer than 1,300 owners of closely held businesses and 300 farmers would have owed the tax. According to the data, 95 percent of the roughly 6,000 farmers who paid estate tax that year would have been exempted under terms of the Democrats' plan, as would 88 percent of the roughly 10,000 small-business owners who paid the tax. Had the estate tax been repealed in 1997, as the Republicans now propose, more than half of the tax savings would have gone to the slightly more than 400 individuals who died that year leaving individual estates worth more than $20 million each. Two prominent experts on estate taxes said yesterday that the Democrats were offering a much better deal to small-business owners and farmers, because the relief under their bill would be immediate and the estate tax would be eliminated for nearly all of them. ''The fact is that the Democrats are making the better offer -- and I'm a Republican saying that,'' said Sanford J. Schlesinger of the law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler in New York. With routine estate planning, he said, the $4 million exemption could effectively be raised to as much as $10 million in wealth that could be passed untaxed to heirs. Only 1,221 of the 2.3 million people who died in 1997 left a taxable estate of $10 million or more, I.R.S. data shows. Neil Harl, an Iowa State University economist who is a leading estate tax adviser to Midwest farmers, said that only a handful of working family farms had a net worth of $4 million. ''Above that, with a very few exceptions, you are talking about the Ted Turners who own huge ranches and are not working farmers,'' he said. Mr. Harl said he was surprised that farmers were not calling lawmakers to demand that they take the president up on his promise to sign the Democratic bill. One reason for that may be that in leading the call for repeal of the tax, two organizations representing merchants and farmers -- the National Federation of Independent Business and the American Farm Bureau Federation -- have done little to tell members about the Democratic plan. Interviews this week with half a dozen people whom the two organizations offered as spokesmen on the estate tax showed that only one of them had any awareness of the Democratic proposal. Officials of the business federation and the farm bureau said that in the event full repeal failed, they might push for approval of the Democratic plan. But both groups say outright repeal makes more sense. ''My concern is not over the Bill Gateses of the world,'' said Jim Hirni, a Senate lobbyist for the business federation. ''But we have to eliminate this tax, because it is too complicated to comply with the rules. Instead of further complicating the system, the best way is to eliminate the tax, period.'' A farm bureau spokesman, Christopher Noun, said that the Democrats' plan appeared to grant benefits that would erode over time. ''Farmers are not cash wealthy, they are asset wealthy,'' he said. ''And those assets are only going to continue to gain value over the years. So while some farmers may not be taxed now under the other plan -- 10 or 15 years out they will.'' Whether the proposal to repeal the tax dies in the Senate or is passed and then vetoed by the President, it will become a powerful tool for both parties in the fall elections. The Republicans will be able to paint themselves as tax cutters who would carry out their plans if they could just win the White House and more seats in Congress. The Democrats could try to paint the Republicans as the party that abandoned Main Street merchants and family farmers to serve the interests of billionaires. A vote in the Senate could come as early as this evening. At the grass roots, however, those who would benefit from any reduction in the scope of the estate tax take a much more pragmatic view of the matter. ''The whole reason I took up this cause is I do not want to see another small family business get into the situation we are in,'' said Mark Sincavage, a land developer in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania whose family expects to sell some raw land soon to pay a $600,000 estate tax bill to the federal and state governments. The independent business federation cited Mr. Sincavage's situation as an especially good example of problems the estate tax causes its members who are asset rich but short on cash. Facing similar circumstances is John H. Kearney, a Ford and Lincoln dealer in Ravena, N.Y., who said he ''got slammed pretty hard'' when his father died last year. Most of his father's $1.6 million estate was in land and the car dealership, said Mr. Kearney, who added that he dipped into savings intended for his children's education to pay the estate tax bill. Neither Mr. Sincavage nor Mr. Kearney said he was aware of the Democrats' plan to roll back the tax. But Mr. Kearney said his interest was in reasonable tax relief so that merchants and farmers could continue to nurture their businesses, not in helping billionaires. ''No part of me has any sympathy for people with more than $5 million,'' he said. ''Would I feel terrible if all they did was raise the exemption to $4 million or $5 million? I would say from my selfish standpoint that we have covered the small family farm and small business and thus we achieved what we wanted to achieve. ''But I would still be asking: Is it really a moral tax to begin with? And that's a point you can argue a hundred different ways.'' Carl Loop, 72, who owns a wholesale decorative-plant nursery in Jacksonville, Fla., said he favored repeal, partly because estate tax planning was fraught with uncertainty. ''The complexity of it keeps a lot of people from doing estate planning because they don't understand it,'' Mr. Loop said. ''And they don't like the fact that they have to give up ownership of property while they are alive.'' Professor Harl, the Iowa State University estate tax expert, said that he had heard many horror stories about people having to sell farms to pay estate taxes. But in 35 years of conducting estate tax seminars for farmers, he added, ''I have pushed and pushed and hunted and probed and I have not been able to find a single case where estate taxes caused the sale of a family farm; it's a myth.''For Indian playwrights, involvement in New York theater has been more a flirtation than anything serious. That has meant mostly short runs, small theaters and few mainstream audiences even for celebrated Indian playwrights. The growing Indian arts community here hopes to change this. Beginning on Friday, the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center is to host a Festival of Indian Theater, which will run for three weeks and include 18 performances. The festival is sponsored by the Indo-American Arts Council, whose director, Aroon Shivdasani, says it is the first such festival in North America. The festival will offer the United States premieres of two plays, in English with all-Indian casts, by two of India's leading playwrights. Mahesh Dattani's ''Dance Like a Man'' is about the conflict between two aging dancers of the classical temple style known as Bharata Natyam, whose careers are ending, and their daughter, whose career is taking off. It was written in English. Vijay Tendulkar's ''Once Upon A Fleeting Bird'' is an English adaptation of a contemporary love story set in Bombay. It was originally performed in the Marathi language. The Asia Society has organized a series of conversations with the playwrights, directors and casts before and after selected performances. ''Indian theater has been shown here, but it has been a one-night stand,'' said Ms. Shivdasani, who was a founder of the small, multicultural Bear Theater Company in Toronto. ''It's one night in Queens, one night in New Jersey, then it's out.'' The Indian plays draw a niche audience, she said. That means that American playgoers miss out on playwrights who are as well-known in their home country as Arthur Miller is here. The Indo-American Arts Council was started two years ago to introduce mainstream American audiences to Indian artists. A film screening or performance is often accompanied by a discussion about broader aspects of Indian culture.

After years of hearing stories about Japan tinged in mistrust and disdain, Mr. Kim, whose troupe was performing a historical play about a Mongol invasion of Japan via Korea, pronounced what amounted to a burying of the hatchet between two of Asia's most closely related, yet persistently contentious, neighbors. ''We don't have the old feelings of hatred toward Japan like we used to anymore,'' he said. ''And I guess our stay here shows that the Japanese have finally learned to respect us, too.'' The burgeoning detente between South Korea and Japan can be seen in many ways, from their agreeing to be co-hosts of the World Cup soccer tournament in 2002, to the increasingly frequent trips back and forth between leaders of the two countries, to South Korea's pending invitation of the Japanese emperor to Seoul, which, given Japan's bitterly resented imperial rule of Korea early this century, would have been unthinkable even just a few years ago. Mr. Kim visited during Korea Week in Fukuoka, where Korean master potters displayed their works and lectured Japanese audiences about ceramics, brought to this country from Korea centuries ago. And Korean flower arrangers showed off their innovations in an art largely inspired by ancient Japanese traditions. But the best reflection of the spreading warmth between the countries is the way travel between them -- not just by business people and officials, but by homemakers, students and ordinary tourists -- has exploded in the last few years, making South Korea the preferred destination of Japanese last year, replacing the longtime favorite, Hawaii. Travel between the countries is booming at a time of historic shifts in relationships throughout the region. Japan and South Korea are enjoying rare warmth in what had long been lucrative but frosty economic ties. For the first time in years, starting with a historic summit meeting of their leaders in June, North and South Korea have been making major progress toward ending the state of war between them. The thaw between North and South Korea, meanwhile, has encouraged the government in Pyongyang, North Korea, to moderate its often shrill rhetoric against Tokyo, and even begin hinting at a reconciliation with Japan, which North Korea usually depicts as the source of evil and corruption in Northeast Asia. The softer tone may reflect a recognition that capital from Japan -- which has the world's second largest economy -- will be indispensable for the reconstruction of a North Korea on the verge of collapse. It would be hard to find a sea boundary in Asia whose history has been more tumultuous or of deeper impact than the Korea Strait, a 100-mile-wide stretch of ocean separating Fukuoka from Pusan, in southern South Korea. Although the subject remains shrouded in mystery and is taboo here, Japan's imperial family is believed by many historians to have arrived from across these seas some 2,000 years ago. The Mongols, who ruled Korea, invaded twice and were defeated the second time only by a typhoon, the original kamikaze, or holy wind, which wrecked their armada of 3,500 ships in 1281. Three centuries later, feudal Japan launched two invasions of its own, involving 150,000 or so troops each time, but was undone by help from Chinese allies and Korea's invention of the world's first armored sea craft, the Turtle Ship. These days, the invasions are different but still aggressive: weekend shopping expeditions and culinary raids for spicy Korean kimchi or delicate Japanese specialties, or school trips, amusement park visits and health spa ''cures.'' Private visits between the two countries are taking place at a rate of more than two million a year, and because of its proximity to the Korean peninsula, Fukuoka, once the favored jumping-off point for conquerors, has become the leading springboard for travelers. Where diplomacy has often come up short in the past, growing contacts like these between South Korea and Japan seem to be changing the ways -- often deeply stereotyped -- the two peoples think about each other. Japanese people visit South Korea and discover a country far more orderly and developed than they had been led to believe. ''I had heard a lot about Korea before I went, but my impressions of the place were much better than the image I used to have,'' said Kyoko Fukuda, a Japanese beautician whose flight from Seoul, where she went to attend a conference, had just landed. ''We have always heard that the living standard is very low there, but in fact the difference was not so terribly great.'' South Koreans, meanwhile, are noting a greater willingness among Japanese to acknowledge them as peers rather than subjects and to acknowledge that Japanese culture has borrowed heavily from its western neighbor -- which is important given South Koreans' deep sense of national pride. In June, as a result, South Korea lifted restrictions on imports of Japanese films and most television programming. The measure follows a more timid relaxation of controls on ''cultural imports'' from Japan that began in 1988. ''The Japanese were deeply influenced by Korea,'' said Lee Kang Hyo, a South Korean ceramics artist who lectured recently in Fukuoka, where Korean masterpieces were on display at a municipal exhibition hall, along with historical correspondence from Hideyoshi, the Japanese shogun who twice invaded the country. ''But you have to come to Japan to see the best of our classical tradition preserved.'' That fact has much to do, Mr. Lee hastened to add, with Japan's 35-year colonization of Korea, which ended in 1945, and its previous conquest of the country, when Korean masterpieces were carted off to Japan in large quantities. But he said he was also surprised to learn during his first visit to Fukuoka, last month, that there was still a deep sense of prestige attached to the classical Korean style here. Japanese academics, meanwhile, say that they have begun to work closely together with their Korean counterparts to piece together the shared history of the two peoples, overcoming a legacy of mutual contempt. ''It is safe to say that Japan had a feeling of superiority over Korea,'' said Koji Saeki, a professor of history at Kyushu University, in Fukuoka. ''But the exchanges between Japanese and Korean scholars are very active now, and they are strengthening all the time.'' It is in the area of the painful history that has long divided the two peoples that the most distance has been traveled. Only in fits and starts has the Japanese government shown a willingness to address the question of Japanese imperial rule over the Korean peninsula, apologizing officially to the Korean government, but devoting relatively little attention in officially sanctioned textbooks to Japanese brutality, like the use of Korean women as sex slaves for the imperial army. Prominent Japanese politicians, meanwhile, periodically continue to make provocative statements about Koreans in Japan, blaming them for crime, for example. Individual Japanese who have traveled to South Korea, however, say that their experience of the country has brought them to reflect deeply about their own country's expansionist past. Often they express a kind of remorse whose sincerity rings far truer than any official declaration. South Korean tour guides play a subtle but important role, deliberately bringing Japanese visitors to sites that commemorate the sacking of their country and attempted destruction of their culture by several generations of Japanese invaders. ''We learned almost nothing about this in school,'' said Makiko Nakatsukuma, a 27-year-old homemaker, who had just traveled with her best friend to Pusan by high-speed ferry for a weekend of shopping. ''In Korea it was explained to us how Japan had forced Koreans to learn our language, and to abandon their names in favor of Japanese names. Many Koreans were brought to Japan by force, too, and had to work as virtual slaves. ''The whole time I was there, I just felt like apologizing to the Korean people. It is very hard to explain, but even though I am from the postwar generations, I felt so bad about all of this. You want to say you are sorry, but who do you say it to?''China's largest steel producer, the Shanghai Baosteel Group, will issue $240 million in corporate bonds in lieu of an overseas stock market listing. In April, the company postponed the sale of its shares abroad because of poor market conditions. It said it still planned to list its shares overseas but would wait for the market climate to improve. Craig S. Smith (NYT) WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: ASIAAffluence is supposed to bring contentment: the satisfaction of basic physical needs, the resources to enjoy more refined pleasures. But in Dave Matthews's songs, affluence can't stave off a crisis that might as well be called spiritual. It leaves him confused, lonely, appalled at his own daily compromises and longing for release. Love would help; God might help, too. But he's not sure he can hold on to either one. At Giants Stadium here on Tuesday night, opening a three-night stand, Mr. Matthews sang, ''I can't believe that we would lie in our graves/Dreaming of things that we might have been.'' His music, at first, seems too fragile and intricate for a stadium show. The songs revolve around Mr. Matthews strumming an acoustic guitar, singing in a voice that rarely finds peace; it broods somewhere between Eddie Vedder and Cat Stevens. There's no bombast in his band of saxophone, violin, bass, drums and keyboards. Most of the time, the music is a briskly syncopated latticework, riding the pinpoint accents that Carter Beauford taps across cymbals, wood blocks and drums. Yet it's not as delicate as it might seem. Boyd Tinsley's violin pulls the songs toward Celtic folk melodies; LeRoi Moore's saxophone and flute solos tilt them toward jazz, and the whole band can mesh for sinewy funk riffs. The music reaches for hybrids, pulling in Fairport Convention, James Brown and Weather Report, slipping into odd meters and piling up prickly dissonances. And for all its ambitions, it creates a sleek momentum. Even when Mr. Matthews sings about being trapped or unsure, the music moves along, and plenty of fans are ready to dance to it. In the last few years Mr. Matthews has become a stadium regular, with thousands of voices singing along as he ponders reasons to live. In a two-and-a-half-hour set, the band progressed from thoughts of overconsumption and overwork in ''Too Much'' to questions about purpose in ''Lie in Our Graves,'' ''Typical Situation'' and a newer song, ''Bartender,'' in which Mr. Matthews prays that money and success not ruin him. Eventually, it found its way to lusty romance, ending with the jubilant ''Rapunzel.'' The band's music is still evolving. Having perfected its own syncopated pointillism, it is testing richer, more sustained textures. ''Bartender,'' based on one long-held chord, pealed like a U2 song, and in another new song, ''Busted Stuff,'' Mr. Matthews and three female backup singers repeated the line ''You're the one for me'' again and again, a mantra of longing and obsession that became richly hypnotic. Remarkably, Mr. Matthews and his band can make a whole stadium look inward. Two opening acts shared the bill. Ben Harper and his band, the Innocent Criminals, are a paradoxical blend of diffidence and arena dynamics. Mr. Harper spent most of the set seated, playing a lap slide guitar and singing in a haunted, androgynous voice about idealistic goals and thwarted love. But from that guitar came muscular blues and boogie licks, climbing toward distorted peaks. The combination was like Led Zeppelin with politically correct self-consciousness instead of bravado. Ozomatli, from Los Angeles, is a polyglot party band. Its first song jumped from samba to merengue within four minutes, and in the course of its set it also touched on hip-hop, dance-hall reggae and Mexican cumbia, all played with gusto and nuance. After finishing its set onstage, Ozomatli paraded into the audience like a brass band, playing a mini-set that mixed samba propulsion with musical quotations from Metallica, Duke Ellington and the ''Looney Tunes'' theme. Ozomatli songs call for unity amid diversity, and its music lived up to that goal. POP REVIEWFour banks that serve about one-third of bank customers in New York State have agreed to stop discouraging consumers from opening low-cost basic accounts, state officials said. The companies -- the Chase Manhattan Corporation, KeyCorp, the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company and HSBC Bank USA -- agreed in a settlement with the attorney general's office to follow a state law that requires them to provide the basic bank accounts. They also agreed to spend $300,000 on a statewide advertising campaign to promote the low-cost accounts. The agreement came after a yearlong investigation by the attorney general's regional office in Syracuse. The investigation was started after a consumer complained that a Chase bank in Syracuse would not allow her to open a low-cost account. Under the informal agreement, the attorney general's office has agreed not to sue the companies if they comply with the law and undertake the consumer ad campaign. Charlotte Gilbert-Biro, a spokeswoman for Chase Manhattan, which banking officials say accounts for about 23 percent of the state's customers, said the company was ''happy to be doing this'' as a part of ''our ongoing efforts'' to inform consumers. Banks are required to offer low-cost accounts under a 1994 state law. Consumers could open such an account with a deposit of as little as $25. Account holders must maintain a minimum monthly balance of 1 cent, and they are charged a monthly maintenance fee of no more than $3. The accounts allow for eight free withdrawals each month and third-party check cashing at no cost to the consumer. Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer said yesterday that ''access to low-cost accounts is a right of all New Yorkers.'' He said that the people who suffered most from unavailability of the low-cost accounts were the poor and the elderly, who often have to rely on check-cashing services that charge a percentage of the check total as a fee. Mr. Spitzer said his investigators found ''industrywide noncompliance'' with the law on low-cost bank accounts and would soon begin discussions with other institutions. Russ Haven, legislative counsel of the New York Public Interest Research Group, which lobbied for the 1994 law, praised the agreement, but said, ''The other part of this story is that the Banking Department has done an awful job enforcing the law and ensuring that the banks promote low-cost checking accounts.'' State Banking Department officials disputed that assertion. An official said there were about one million basic accounts in the state.Shutterbugs with a passion for instantly shared experiences will soon be able to send their digital photos by e-mail without ever touching their computers. Wireless photo transmission is being made possible by Digita Post software currently available in Kodak DC290 digital cameras. The software, developed by FlashPoint Technology, based in San Jose, Calif., works with the company's Digita technology, which functions as an operating system for digital cameras. Transmitting photos from digital cameras to cell phones and then to any e-mail box anywhere in the world is expected to be particularly handy for insurance adjusters, police officers and paramedics, though the biggest market for the cameras is expected to be among nonprofessionals, said Karen Meyers, a company spokeswoman. A user inserts a flash card into the camera and takes standard digital photos. Then the user starts up the camera's Digita Post software, which allows the user to select which photos to send and even attach text and sound messages (the Kodak DC290 has a tiny microphone). The camera is then connected to a cell phone through a cable. With another click, the photos are on their way. They arrive in the receiver's e-mail In box as a message with an attached JPEG file. Sounds arrive as WAV file attachments. Digita Post is expected to cost $199 and will be available in late September on the FlashPoint Web site (www.flashpoint.com). Other camera manufacturers that offer Digita-enabled cameras -- including Minolta, Hewlett-Packard and Sharp -- are expected to incorporate the Digita Post software, too, Ms. Meyers said. BONNIE ROTHMAN MORRIS NEWS WATCHIn 1995, the year before state education officials stepped in to overhaul the troubled Roosevelt school district on Long Island, just four graduating seniors received the respected Regents diplomas, symbolizing academic success in a host of subject areas. This year, after five years of the state's efforts, 6 students did so, out of a graduating class of 107. By almost any measure, the Roosevelt Free Union School District has barely improved and the state's attempt to turn it around is in disarray. The chairman of the state advisory panel that oversees the district resigned last month, the third change in the panel's leadership in five years. For months this spring, members of the state panel and the Roosevelt Board of Education were barely speaking to one another. The school district, meanwhile, has employed four superintendents in five years. Now, with one year remaining in the state's legislative mandate to set the district's 3,000 students on a path toward academic success, the effort is at a critical crossroads. Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, told the Roosevelt Board of Education this week that the district must show measurable progress this year in four areas -- local leadership, curriculum, financial stability and community support -- or face further state intervention. The district's students, he added, must meet specific targets on standardized tests in math and in English. Today, Mr. Mills will tell the Board of Regents what he plans to do if the district does not meet those goals. His options, however, appear to be limited. Simply ending state oversight without demonstrable academic progress would be an admission of failure at a time when Gov. George E. Pataki's administration is seeking to impose tougher learning standards on students throughout the state. And the district itself is confronting severe budget constraints, brought on by voters who rejected a construction bond issue and defeated proposed tax increases that would have raised school spending. Meanwhile, several members of the Board of Regents, including Chancellor Carl T. Hayden, oppose a direct takeover of Roosevelt's operations. A more severe option would be to revoke the registration of the Roosevelt middle and high schools and disperse its students. But people on all sides of the debate over Roosevelt schools say that option could be too politically charged to carry out, given that the district's students, who are overwhelmingly black and Hispanic, would have to be transferred to schools that are far more affluent and largely white. And the state has a significant investment beyond the district, as it tackles problems at 104 other failing schools, 97 of them in New York City. Critics of state supervision point to the lack of progress at Roosevelt, and ask whether the state's floundering role there indicates deeper flaws in the state's program for imposing tough standards on failing schools statewide. Mr. Mills said in an interview that Roosevelt's elementary schools had improved in recent years, and that the district had made progress in renovating crumbling buildings. But in the middle and high schools, continual turnover in teachers and administrators combined with the instability in the district's leadership have made any sustained progress all but impossible, he said. In Roosevelt, news of Mr. Mills's mandates for this year -- and the implied threat of more severe action next year -- raised hackles among some residents at a Board of Education meeting on Tuesday night. ''Now that they've made a mess of things, they're trying to put the onus on our board of education,'' said Serretta C. McKnight, who was president of the school board that was removed by the State Education Department in 1996. ''They want us to do lickety-split what they haven't done in five years.'' Since 1990, the Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School, a combined school that the state wants to split up, has been listed as underperforming, with low test scores and low graduation rates. In March 1995, a state panel issued a harshly critical review, leading the State Legislature to grant Governor Pataki's request for intervention. While the legislation authorized the removal of the school board, a move the state took in early 1996, it left long-term governance to a new school board, elected a few months later. Since then, the state's power has been limited to advising the new board on recommended reforms. The state has also provided financial support, including legislative approval of an advance of $4 million in each of the last several years when the district essentially ran out of money before the end of the fiscal year. Better fiscal management is one of the state's goals for the district this year, Mr. Mills said. Entwined with that, he added, is the need to improve relations between the district and local residents, who have voted down school budget increases in each of the last two years. Last month, voters also defeated a $70 million school construction bond issue. Because of those votes the district, which is in southern Nassau County, faces a second straight year of a so-called austerity budget, which limits any spending increase to the level of inflation. Meanwhile, a charter school is scheduled to open in the fall, which will take $1.7 million out of the district's $35 million budget. In a school district with high poverty rates and virtually no commercial tax base, paying for the school system is a continuing problem. ''The people who live here are overassessed and overtaxed,'' said Francis Cooper, a Roosevelt resident who regularly attends school board meetings. ''But the state, in coming to Roosevelt, didn't bring any financial resources to the table. They gave us a loan of $4 million, which actually puts us further in the hole.'' Mr. Mills contends, however, that the district has harmed itself, in part by not applying for grants and other state money for which the district is eligible. Mark Davis, who was elected president of the Roosevelt school board on Tuesday, said the board had begun to formulate plans to achieve the commissioner's goals, including his directive to hire chairmen for its math and English departments. In addition, a recently approved teachers' contract raises pay scales and should reduce teacher turnover. While Roosevelt's per pupil spending and teacher salaries are above the state average, they have been below that of nearby districts. But Mr. Davis said the state had failed to provide the financial resources necessary to allow the district to hire the administrators it needed to accomplish the changes the state wanted. ''The board is not short of plans to improve the district; we're short of people to execute the plans,'' he said. On all sides, participants have pointed fingers at others who they say are to blame for the district's problems. Michael Mostow, who retired as superintendent last month after losing the support of the board, said the State Education Department contained mainly theorists who did not have the skills to help a district with day-to-day operations. Ken Stubbolo, who resigned last month as a member of the state advisory board, said the Roosevelt Board of Education thwarted the efforts of the state advisers, who were in turn hamstrung by the Legislature's failure to give the oversight panel any operational responsibility. There is plenty of blame to go around, said the Rev. Reginald Tuggle, pastor of Memorial Presbyterian Church in Roosevelt, who once worked with the state panel and who is now on the board of the recently approved charter school. ''There has been an absence of constructive parental and community involvement,'' he said. ''I know everybody means well -- the state, the school board and the administration. But this is a small school district. I don't know why they can't pull this together. It's hurting our children.''A startling photograph has surfaced showing Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey grinning while frisking a black man who has his hands up and is facing a wall. The picture was taken on a night in 1996 when she accompanied state troopers who were patrolling in Camden. The man she frisked had apparently already been searched by the troopers for weapons and drugs and then handed over to the governor. The man had not been accused of any crime. The picture has caused a furor, and Mrs. Whitman is now criticizing her critics for taking the picture ''out of context.'' But the fact remains that the posed look of the photograph and Mrs. Whitman's smiling expression add up to the appearance of a gratuitous insult. The controversy over the photo may also help explain why Mrs. Whitman has had so much trouble putting the political problem of racial profiling by New Jersey state troopers behind her. One reason the issue will not disappear is that racial profiling -- the targeting and searching of motorists based solely on race -- has gone on for years, despite denials by political leaders like Mrs. Whitman. Also, the anger and mistrust in minority communities over this issue are deeply rooted, despite Mrs. Whitman's subsequent acknowledgment of the problem and her efforts to deal with it. The photograph simply feeds that anger and mistrust. Mrs. Whitman insists the episode had nothing to do with racial profiling. But that does not change the fact that the man in the picture was treated callously by the person who is chiefly responsible for setting the direction and tone of law enforcement in the state. To be fair, Mrs. Whitman was the first New Jersey governor to acknowledge that state troopers had engaged in systematic racial profiling. In the past year she began efforts to combat profiling as part of a consent decree entered into between the state and the Justice Department. She has also conceded that state police commanders have tolerated racial and sexual discrimination against minority and female officers. In the face of numerous lawsuits brought by former state troopers, she has ordered an overhaul of the agency's hiring and promotion practices and its command structure. But those bureaucratic reforms do not take the sting out of the photo. Mrs. Whitman's refusal to apologize for the conduct in the photo adds to public skepticism that her administration will energetically crack down on illegal policing practices. A lawyer for two troopers who have been criminally charged for shooting three unarmed minority men on the New Jersey Turnpike has already said the photo will be used to support their contention that racial profiling was encouraged by the police leadership. If the governor cares to heal the mistrust, she needs to show that she understands why the picture is offensive to so many people.Marriott International in Bethesda, Md., is naming Siegelgale in New York to handle advertising, branding and communications for its full-service Marriott and Renaissance lodging properties. The decision on the account, with billings estimated at $20 million, came without a formal review. There has been no agency for Marriott and Renaissance since last year, when the New York office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group, resigned the assignment. McCann-Erickson is owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies. THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDAMarcel Ospel, the chief executive of UBS A.G. in Zurich, built much of his career by buying American. But while his $12 billion deal to acquire the PaineWebber Group gives his huge Swiss bank a big new position in the United States, Mr. Ospel is in many ways a man under fire. UBS, formed through the merger in 1998 of the Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation, has spent much of the last two years struggling to find its focus and balance. Its previous chief executive, Mathis Cabiallavata, resigned after UBS amassed huge losses lending money to the ill-fated American hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management. Mr. Ospel, 50, former head of Swiss Bank, took over with the goals of sharply reducing the combined bank's exposure to risk and refocusing on what seemed to be its essential strength as a Swiss bank with global reach: managing money for wealthy individuals worldwide. But Swiss banking is under siege from global competition, as are banks across Europe. Much of that competition is from Wall Street investment banks, which have aggressively moved into the role of advisers to top European corporations. Much of the pressure also comes from the United States' standing as the biggest and probably fastest-growing market for affluent financial customers. Although UBS is one of the world's biggest banks, with roughly $1 trillion in assets under management, its vaunted private banking business slumped badly last year. Just today, UBS disclosed that profit in its private banking area dropped 18 percent in the second quarter just ended, compared with the first quarter. In a terse announcement regarding its second-quarter earnings, UBS said ''preliminary indications are that net new money and asset growth remain disappointing.'' That news comes three months after Mr. Ospel ousted the previous head of private banking and announced a broad restructuring of the operation. Mr. Ospel has also been under tremendous pressure, from investors as well as some UBS executives, to sell the investment banking business Warburg Dillon Read. That did not happen, but UBS did scale back on its trading activities in the United States and many Warburg executives defected to other firms. The PaineWebber deal is supposed to solve these and other problems. Using PaineWebber's network of 8,500 brokers in the United States, Mr. Ospel hopes to reach a huge new market of wealthy Americans, shore up his wobbly private banking business and sharply increase UBS's total assets under management. The bank is paying a high price for PaineWebber, 47 percent above the broker's stock price before the deal was announced. To keep more executives from fleeing to rivals, UBS has allocated $875 million for incentive payments. And it estimates restructuring costs around $400 million. Analysts predict that PaineWebber will not do much to help Warburg take on the likes of the Goldman Sachs Group or Merrill Lynch in the hotly competitive arenas of advising on mergers and acquisitions and corporate finance. Though Warburg has a strong investment banking business in Europe, it is considered second tier in the United States, and PaineWebber's primary strength is as a retail broker. But industry experts said UBS did not have many realistic choices of American partners, and PaineWebber's strengths should complement those of UBS. ''It makes a lot of sense strategically,'' said Madeleine Hofmann, banking analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in Zurich. ''UBS Warburg has very good people in private banking and investment banking, but in the U.S. they really did not have retail distribution. The major point is to build the affluent-client segment abroad, outside Switzerland.'' Others had lukewarm reactions. ''It is not the ideal acquisition, but realistically it is as close to the ideal as you can get,'' said Bryan Crossley, a banking analyst at ABN Amro. ''It doesn't really get them to the top level, but to do that you would have had to acquire somebody like Merrill Lynch, which is a different proposition.'' Mr. Ospel has considerable experience with American acquisitions. At the old Swiss Bank Corporation, he played a central role in 1995 in acquiring SG Warburg, then a dreary spinoff from Morgan Stanley, and in 1997 he acquired Dillon Read, then a boutique corporate advisory firm. Swiss Bank also acquired two small but valuable firms in Chicago: a derivatives business, O'Connor Associates, that gave it a solid base in what turned out to be a profitable area of trading, and Brinson Asset Management, a thriving money management firm. Industry executives say that Swiss Bank, smaller and scrappier than the Union Bank of Switzerland, did a good job of melding the longtime rivals together and letting executives who were not Swiss continue to build those businesses on their own. By some estimates, Warburg Dillon Read might have sold for as much as $18 billion if UBS had offered it last year. Some of UBS's problems reflect the rocky integration of its two Swiss components. Mr. Cabiallavata came from the bigger but stodgier Union Bank; Mr. Ospel from Swiss Bank. Mr. Cabiallavata pushed through a grueling cutback, closing branches and getting rid of many executives. When Mr. Cabiallavata resigned, taking responsibility for the losses incurred on the loans to Long-Term Capital, Mr. Ospel took over and the company came largely under the management of former Swiss Bank executives. UBS performance improved considerably in 1999, as net income doubled from 6.3 billion Swiss francs, or about $3.9 billion. Much of that gain came from Warburg's investment banking business, which surged as the financial markets did in general. But profit in private banking shrank 39 percent and the bank's asset management business lost many big customers. INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSTwo centuries after George Washington signed into law a bill establishing a federal city on the Potomac, historians and lawmakers are now learning that most of the laborers who erected the White House and the Capitol were black slaves. A local television reporter, Edward Hotaling, several months ago unearthed Treasury Department pay slips in the Capitol dating back 200 years. The pay slips showed that from 1792 to 1800 -- the years the reporter zeroed in on -- more than 400 of the 600 workers who helped erect the White House and the Capitol were black slaves whose wages were appropriated by their owners. Now a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Congress, led by Representative J. C. Watts Jr., Republican of Oklahoma, is calling for a task force to study the documents and recommend how best to commemorate the black slaves, who were never recognized or rewarded for their role. The memorial would occupy a ''prominent'' place in the Capitol, Mr. Watts said. ''Who were these men who worked here?'' asked Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and a one-time civil rights leader. ''What happened to them?'' Representative Danny K. Davis, Democrat of Illinois, said it was important to honor the slaves who helped erect two of the country's most visible symbols of democracy, and not shy away from that fact. ''Slavery indeed was a shameful period in the history of this nation but we have a responsibility not to run away from any aspect of it,'' Mr. Davis said. ''It's incumbent upon us to uncover and reveal what was actually taking place.'' Mr. Hotaling said he came across the records in March while he was reporting a story on the 200th anniversary of the White House and the Capitol. Each pay slip contained the name of the plantation owner, the slave and the wages paid to the owner: $5 a month. Mr. Hotaling said he focused on the years 1792 and 1800, and then ran out of time. Construction of the Capitol was not completed until the 1860's, and the White House was finished in 1800. Slavery was not outlawed in Washington until 1865. Little else is known about the slave laborers, something Mr. Watts said he hoped to rectify with the task force, which would include several historians. Mr. Watts said he expected the resolution to sail through the House and Senate in the next month, adding that he would like the task force to make its recommendations by year's end. In the Senate, the resolution is being sponsored by Senators Spencer Abraham, Republican of Michigan, and Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas. It will be called, Mr. Watts said with a chuckle, the Abraham Lincoln resolution.Saying that globalization is showing no signs of slowing and that further international financial crises are all but inevitable, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, offered a wide-ranging set of prescriptions last night for preventing and coping with acute economic problems around the world. Drawing on lessons learned during the financial crisis that began in Asia in 1997, Mr. Greenspan said industrialized and developing countries alike needed to focus on developing strong banking systems and active capital markets so that if one source of financing dried up, another would be available. He stressed the need for governments to regulate their financial systems adequately, for governments and the private sectors to provide investors with full and timely economic and financial information, and for governments not to insulate investors from risk by bailing them out when times become tough. And he warned about allowing a buildup of debt within the financial system. Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Mr. Greenspan did not mention current economic conditions in the United States or provide any hints about whether the Fed would raise interest rates again when it meets next, on Aug. 22. Mr. Greenspan is scheduled to testify about monetary policy before the Senate Banking Committee next Thursday. Mr. Greenspan broke no new ground in his speech. But he said it was ''essential that we employ the current period of relative international financial stability to address as best we can some of the more evident short-run potentials for crises.'' The key, he said, is to develop ''flexible institutions that can adapt to the unforeseeable needs of the next crisis, not financial Maginot lines.'' One reason to be flexible, he said, is the complexity of the financial transactions and instruments through which capital flows around the world. The best insurance against allowing a nasty surprise to develop under the cloak of complexity, he suggested, is to limit the amount of debt in the system. Mr. Greenspan spent much of his speech building a case that countries with both strong banking systems and healthy capital markets were far better able to weather financial troubles than countries that have only one or the other. Countries like Thailand and Japan that relied heavily, if not exclusively, on their banking systems found themselves without another steady source of capital when their banks ran into trouble, he said. But countries like the United States and Sweden, he said, have come through crises relatively unscathed because they were able to turn to banks when their capital markets landed in trouble, and vice versa.A 24-year-old woman was slashed to death inside her Queens apartment yesterday by three men who also nailed the hands of her live-in boyfriend to a two-by-four and took thousands of dollars from a safe, the police said. The police did not release the name of the woman, pending notification of her family. They said she worked as a topless dancer at Ten's, a cabaret in Manhattan, and was thought to have been from Canada. They found her with her throat slashed early yesterday in her apartment on 135th Street in the Briarwood neighborhood. The man described by the police as her boyfriend, Todd Taylor, 34, was taken to Mary Immaculate Hospital, treated for injuries to his hands and released about 10 a.m., said Daphne Lawrence, a hospital spokeswoman. Mr. Taylor's hands had been nailed behind his back to a wooden post with two nails apiece, said Lt. Stephen Biegel, a police spokesman. Mr. Taylor called 911 at 4:24 a.m., but it was not clear how, the police said. Mr. Taylor told investigators that he awoke early yesterday to find three men, clad in stocking masks and gloves, inside the apartment. Further details about the victims and the crime, including the amount of money taken, were sketchy yesterday. Outside the three-story red-brick house in a quiet neighborhood of tree-lined streets, a steady flow of police investigators streamed in and out. They collected evidence throughout the day. A driveway at the apartment building was marked off with four bright orange cones and red tape. Neighbors watched as the police removed a body bag from the apartment building just after 1:30 p.m. Few seemed to know anything about the couple. Anthony Sorensen, 21, who lives in a building across the street, said he had occasionally seen the woman coming and going, but did not know her name. Mr. Sorensen, who was walking his two pit bulls yesterday, said that earlier the police had asked him whether he had heard anything unusual the night before. He told them that he had not and that his dogs, who usually bark if they hear a disturbance in the neighborhood, were quiet Tuesday night, he said. Like other residents, he was surprised by the crime. ''Nothing really happens here, maybe a stolen car occasionally,'' he said. ''But we don't hear about stuff like this happening. It's kind of scary.'' A woman who answered the telephone yesterday at Ten's, at 35 East 21st Street, said the club had not been contacted by police investigators.Dell Computer of Round Rock, Tex., has pulled the plug on its Web-based PC for computer novices. The WebPC, introduced in November at $999, was neither simple nor inexpensive enough to catch on, and it has disappeared from Dell's Web site. Rather than chasing the market for inexpensive Net appliances, Dell introduced a midrange line, the Dimension 4100, this week. A Dimension 4100 computer with a 733-megahertz processor, 128 megabytes of memory, a 10-gigabyte hard drive and a 17-inch monitor costs $1,299. Compaq, meanwhile, discontinued the sleek Presario 3500. It will be sold only in Japan. NEWS WATCHOverlooking Park Avenue on one of the choicest pieces of real estate in the city, the red brick Seventh Regiment Armory is considered both an architectural treasure and one of the country's leading showplaces for internationally renowned art, antiques and crafts exhibitions. But it is also viewed as a wasted opportunity, a long-neglected, badly deteriorated structure with crumbling ceilings and leaky walls, where space for which exhibition promoters clamor is rented out for a pittance. Seeking to reverse the armory's long decline and turn it into a money-making cultural center, the state yesterday invited nonprofit organizations and private companies to submit proposals for rehabilitating and operating the building, which occupies a full block between 66th and 67th Streets. City officials and civic leaders praised the state yesterday for recognizing the building's importance as a prime example of late Victorian architecture and design and coming up with sound criteria for restoring its grandeur. ''This clearly establishes that the use has to be consistent with the historic character of the armory and respectful of one of our most important neighborhoods,'' said Kent Barwick, the president of the Municipal Art Society, referring to the state's request for proposals. Mr. Barwick is also a board member of the Seventh Regiment Armory Conservancy, a nonprofit group that is expected to bid for the armory contract. Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development arm, said he expected several bidders to emerge. State officials said the Whitney Museum of American Art is interested in the site, but museum officials declined to confirm that yesterday. Kurt Masur, the music director of the New York Philharmonic, has said he would like to set up a summer home for the orchestra in the armory. ''I know that he is certainly interested,'' said a spokesman, Eric Latsky. And the Seventh Regiment Fund, a private organization that has been engaged in a protracted legal battle with the state over the ownership of the armory's multimillion-dollar collection of paintings and military regalia, is seeking to turn the armory into a military and decorative arts museum, said David L. Dalva II, an antiques dealer and the group's vice president. But to succeed, a bidder will have to have access to deep pockets. Mr. Gargano said it would cost an estimated $50 million to repair the armory. The structure was built with private funds between 1877 and 1881 as the headquarters of the socially prominent Seventh Regiment, which held social events to attract and maintain its elite volunteer membership. The armory's dozen ornate rooms, decorated by some of the nation's most prominent interior designers, are among the finest surviving examples of the American Esthetic Movement. Some of the interior was designed by the architect Stanford White and furnished by Louis Comfort Tiffany. In recent years, large sections of the armory have been unused, Mr. Gargano said, adding, ''Any building that's not fully used always has a tendency to deteriorate.'' Before issuing the request for proposals, the state spent two years consulting with community and civic groups. But a housing shelter there remains a source of contention. Some community leaders said yesterday that they were disappointed that the state had not insisted on preserving the city shelter for homeless women that has occupied the third and fifth floors of the armory for about 15 years. The state said that prospective developers would not be required to accommodate the shelter, although they are not precluded from doing so. Nancy Wackstein, the executive director of the Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, a nonprofit organization that operates the shelter for the city, said she had hoped that the state would encourage developers to retain the home, which currently houses 100 women who are 45 and older and is the only publicly financed homeless shelter on the Upper East Side. ''We were hoping for more affirmative statements that the shelter can and should remain,'' Ms. Wackstein said. ''If it's displaced, there's no place else for it to go. This community, as every other community, has a responsibility to help address the homeless problem.'' She said that at the very least, developers who plan to include a shelter should be given preference by the state. M. Barry Schneider, the chairman of Community Board 8, whose district includes the armory, said that keeping the shelter had been one of the community's overriding concerns during its meetings with state officials. ''They have not been a problem,'' Mr. Schneider said of the shelter, ''and they do good work. They ought to have been given a better deal.'' City and state officials, however, said the shelter had wound up in the Armory only as an emergency measure and would need to be moved anyway while extensive renovations are made. Jennifer J. Raab, chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission and the city's representative on the state's armory advisory council, said the city would help Ms. Wackstein to find another location if necessary. The deadline for submitting proposals to the state is Oct. 16. A short list of finalists will be announced on Jan. 15. State officials said they expected to choose a final bid by spring of next year.Tony Earley and his wife, Sarah Bell Earley, were standing in their mustard-yellow kitchen, opening mail. ''French's Mustard yellow,'' Ms. Earley said. ''If you hold the jar up to the wall, it's almost identical.'' The Earleys had been on the road for six weeks, promoting Mr. Earley's first novel, ''Jim the Boy,'' published by Little, Brown last month. Mr. Earley read a congratulatory postcard from a college acquaintance. ''He stole my girl in 1984,'' Mr. Earley said, with some humor and some pique. ''And now he's writing me a postcard. I suppose he thinks I forgot.'' Things worked out, as stories involving writers often do. The Earleys, from the same town in North Carolina, Rutherfordton, married in 1993. ''I grew up in a very tiny country Baptist church,'' Mr. Earley said, sitting in the vestibule of their five-room Victorian house in a gentrifying neighborhood of English-cottage gardens and late-model Saabs and chainlink fenced front yards with plastic doghouses and mongrel dogs. ''I started going to the Episcopal church in our hometown just to impress another woman I was dating at the time, and developed a crush on this girl who sang in the choir. Sitting in church I felt like just a complete heel, because I was there with my girlfriend, but I was longing for this girl in the choir. ''I married the girl in the choir.'' Mr. Earley's first book, ''Here We Are in Paradise,'' short stories, was published in 1994. He was chosen by Granta in 1996 as one of the 20 best young American writers, and in 1999 by The New Yorker as one of ''20 writers for the 21st century.'' Mr. Earley, 39, has taught writing at Vanderbilt University since 1997. ''Jim the Boy'' is the crystalline story of a year in the life of Jim Glass, a 10-year-old boy growing up in rural North Carolina during the Depression. Mr. Earley said that he wrote the book in the style of children's classics like ''Charlotte's Web'' and ''The Yearling,'' as ''a children's book for adults.'' Janet Maslin reviewing it in The New York Times, called the novel a ''radiant, knowing, pitch-perfect parable of childhood.'' Mr. Earley's own childhood and adulthood have been darker. He battles depression: the bright scars of his most recent bout grace the walls as colorful folk paintings he made when he couldn't write. ''After 'Here We Are in Paradise' came out, I got sick, and stayed sick for a couple of years,'' said Mr. Earley, who speaks quietly and carefully, and with the occasional running jump of an enthusiastic boy. ''I was on the suicide watch for a while. I didn't know if I'd ever write again.'' He started painting on a stack of discarded storm windows, then slowly writing, too. ''I bought a bunch of cheap paint at Wal-Mart and I started making big words on them,'' he said. ''That's how I started coming out of it: one big word at a time.'' Mr. Earley discounted any therapeutic interpretation of his new book, but said of the nearly clairvoyant simplicity of Jim's impressions, ''On some level that I didn't understand, I wrote the book that I needed to read.'' Without bearings, in unfamiliar country at the end of the book, Jim asks, ''Which way is home?'' By the author's implication, it is a child's question that most adults spend their lives answering. ''I was way too sensitive for life on planet Earth,'' Mr. Earley said of himself when he was Jim's age. ''Noises were too long and lights were too bright and my feelings were always hurt. It was just because, I think, I was so incredibly thin-skinned.'' Mr. Earley's father was a welder; his mother worked in a department store. His sister was killed in an automobile accident when he was a freshman at Warren Wilson College in Asheville. ''We grew up in a suburb of a town with 3,000 people in it,'' he said. Mr. Earley's parents' marriage was troubled until he returned from college as an adult, a tension he said dispossessed his happiness in the house. Mr. Earley liked his maternal grandmother's house, ''a big old folk Victorian'' with a parlor and Sunday furniture as he called it, where the preacher sat when he visited. In his book, Mr. Earley has turned a child's sensitivities into writerly strengths; domestic events have an extraordinary witness. Jim's father dies without warning the week before he is born; at 10, he is as old as his mother's unending grief. By his 11th birthday, he has stepped into the world, wading into its strong waters on a trip to the Atlantic Ocean. At midnight, he has watched Aliceville, his upland county town, visited like a disturbing Bible vision by electric light. On the porch of a moonshiner's shack, he has pressed his nose to a rusted screen, scratched it with his finger and seen his young father rise like river mist in the breath of the dying man inside. And at the center of his family circle, Jim's childhood has the buoyant weight of love. North Carolina country is Jim's natural sense of place and the haunt of his understanding of the importance of home. It is the other large character in the book. ''I think it's just a family thing,'' said Mr. Earley, whose family, ''both sides,'' have lived for generations within a five-mile radius in a corner of western North Carolina. ''When every one of your ancestors has been looking at the same landscape for 200 years, it becomes rooted like family, passed on, maybe even genetic.'' That kind of orientation -- which closes the book as Jim sights Aliceville from the top of a mountain, and realizes that only home has the power to hold the great world's center -- is being lost, Mr. Earley fears. ''I notice it in the accents of students,'' he said, ''particularly female students. They have the same accent, no matter what part of the country they're from -- a sort of a Valley Girl, television accent. They sound alike.'' Now, he has his own branch of the family, living in Nashville with Ms. Earley, a former seminary student, and their two Jack Russell terriers, Jubal and Rastus. ''She's the C.E.O. of the family,'' Mr. Earley said of his wife as he stood in her office. ''I'm production and she's management.'' On the mantel was a map of North Carolina. Behind a rocking chair hung three quilts, made by his grandmothers. ''Not fancy quilts,'' he said. ''Just everyday quilts.'' The house is furnished with modest, friendly-looking pieces from a previous era, which the Earleys bought cheaply as a young married couple for their first home. ''We were just broke,'' he said. ''We lived in a depressed little steel town outside of Pittsburgh. Because it was so depressed, we managed to buy and renovate a house. All of our furniture we bought at used furniture stores in the Ohio River Valley in these other little depressed steel towns strung out along the river. I had a route I drove every Saturday looking for nice furniture that was cheap. Because we got it with smoke and mirrors, I'm attached to it.'' As a storyteller, Mr. Earley also has a sympathy with the sincerity and drollness of folk art. ''I have a slight weakness for folk art,'' he said. ''Sarah manages to keep it under control. I'd have paintings on plywood all over the house if it were left up to me.'' In the kitchen is a copy of a Cezanne still life. ''It's by a guy we found in Florida who was so excited we were interested in his pictures he gave us three,'' Mr. Earley said. ''His pictures were hanging in a filling station. They'd been there four years and nobody had ever even asked about them.'' Ms. Earley pointed out that the back line of a table in the picture is untrue, shifting planes behind the globes of fruit. ''I thought that was just his mistake, but in the Cezanne, it's not even across, either,'' she said. ''It's an accurate copy -- the colors are just completely different.'' On a bookcase in the vestibule is a wood Madonna nursing a child, carved with a chain saw by a sculptor in Mr. Earley's home county. ''Baptists wandered up into the yard and gave him hard time about a nursing Madonna,'' Mr. Earley recalled. '' 'Well, Jesus had to eat didn't he?' he said to them.'' In the Earleys' bedroom is a hand-lettered sign set on the lintel of a closet. The sign is naive but not art. ''EVERY DAY I WRITE THE BOOK,'' it says. Below it is a pad of large papers with fierce red numbers drawn on them, tacked to the doorjamb like the marks a child makes to measure his height. They are the numbers of the chapters in ''Jim the Boy'' -- a lottery that Mr. Earley fought not to lose for six years. ''The better I get, the more I feel like I have to lose,'' he said. ''I don't want to give any ground back. I haven't always been where I am now. I don't want to go back to where I was. I don't want to have to climb this hill again.'' As with the terrain of ''Jim the Boy,'' familiarity can vanish with each new view. ''It's too big,'' says Jim, seeing his world from the mountain, faltering briefly as an adult. Mr. Earley, who says he wishes to write ''The Complete Jim Glass,'' intends to let him grow into it. AT HOME WITH/TONY EARLEYTo the Editor: ''Something to Watch Over Me'' (July 6) explains an intriguing technology, but it may give parents the wrong idea. It refers to a mother who rested by a pool at the water park because she knew she could find her daughters with tracking devices. Did she think that the ability to locate her children from a kiosk meant that they were safe? Technology like this cannot prevent kidnappings or drownings. It is not a substitute for watching out for your child's safety. LEE MILLSTEIN Chappaqua, N.Y.POWERS-Marcia (Pergament). Devoted mother of Garry and Mel; loving mother-in-law of Michael and Mary; cherished grandmother of Alicia and Paul, Holly, Lauren, Melissa and Dr. Michael Levine and great-grandmother of Benjamin. Always in our thoughts, forever in our hearts and still sadly missedRon Low said yesterday that he is ''a firm believer in not looking at the past.'' And yet, many of the themes that ran through Low's introductory news conference as the 30th head coach in Rangers history hark back to the disaster of last season. Low stressed the need for an attitude change on a team that has failed to make the playoffs in each of the last three springs. ''It's imperative that there is an adjustment,'' said Low, who will be welcoming back Mark Messier to the club today at a morning news conference. The team announced last night that it had reached agreement with the free-agent center, who reportedly got a two-year deal worth $8 million. ''I don't expect it to be easy,'' Low said of his task ahead. ''But I also think the people that are here can get it done.'' He was referring to his two new assistants, Ted Green and Walt Kyle. He was also referring to Glen Sather, the Rangers' president and general manager, who hired him. All four men worked together at Edmonton. Yesterday all four stressed the same themes -- familiarity, loyalty, the ability to communicate, being on the same page -- that were absent on the Rangers last season. Singling out the Rangers' work ethic, Low said: ''Obviously, it wasn't good last year. It couldn't have been good. There were too many underachievers.'' Said Sather: ''Even the cabdrivers have told me that. I've stayed in a couple of different hotels and the bellmen have told me that.'' Sather, who was not able to hire either Kevin Lowe or Craig MacTavish for the top job -- turned to another person with Oiler roots. ''The thinking was that we wouldn't have to go through a honeymoon together,'' Sather said, explaining his selection of Low, who was Sather's head coach in Edmonton for four-plus seasons. ''We know each other.'' That said, Sather laid down his first mandate since becoming team president and general manager on June 1. ''It is not acceptable for this team not to make the playoffs,'' Sather said. Low was asked if that put pressure on him. ''I'm sure it does,'' he said. ''This game comes with a lot of pressure.'' Low was asked if he felt added pressure by having the reigning Stanley Cup champion Devils across the Hudson River. ''Absolutely none,'' Low said, before referring to the Islanders. ''The team the other way is vastly improved, too.'' Low said he would like the Rangers to play the up-tempo style that became synonymous with Edmonton. He also made a distinction between the Oilers and this Rangers team. The former was built on youth and speed. The latter is laden with older, skilled players. ''That's not the same type of team,'' said Low, who was coach and general manager of the Houston Aeros of the International Hockey League last season. ''I understand that totally. Can you play the same way? I think you can. But if you can't, I'm very comfortable with backing up. I trapped last year in Houston. We will look at the situation here and judge ourselves accordingly.'' Low also promised not to judge the Rangers on last season's fiasco. ''I don't think all those guys they signed last year are over the hill or finished,'' Low said. ''There had to be problems last year. We have to find out what they were and solve them.'' The Rangers are obviously hoping that Messier, the former captain who led the team to a Stanley Cup in 1994, will be one of the solutions. The team has not been in the playoffs since his departure in 1997. ''What Mark brings to the table is incredible leadership,'' Low said before the Messier agreement was announced. ''People rally around him. He'd be a great guy to coach.'' Many around the league believe that Messier could be a strong influence on Pavel Brendl, Jamie Lundmark and Manny Malhotra. Sather was asked yesterday if there would be spots for the team's young players. ''Absolutely,'' he said. ''I'm trying to make some changes in the organization. With the set-up of this hockey team, some of those changes are going to take time. But the plan is to make some changes. We're not going to force-feed somebody on the team who's not ready. They're going to have to make the hockey club, just like all the veterans.'' Low, who said he wanted to look at everyone, mentioned Mike York, the Rangers' top rookie last season, as someone he wants to see firsthand. ''I know Brendl is an unbelievable goal scorer,'' Low said. ''It would be nice if he's ready, but I definitely wouldn't put any pressure on him. Lundmark definitely excites you, also. Malhotra, I don't know enough about. But I know one thing about him: he can skate, which likely puts him in my plans. I don't know exactly where he fits. But I like people who can skate.'' Low is being reunited with Sather one year after leaving Edmonton in a contract dispute. ''It might have been a little silly pride,'' Low said. ''The fact that I thought I deserved a raise after getting the team into the playoffs and then knocking off heavily favored opponents twice in a row. I didn't want to be the lowest-paid coach in the league anymore. So I left. And I put my family into a tenuous position there for a while. But now, I'm not regretting the decision at all.'' He signed a deal believed to be for three years at about $700,000 a season. ''Obviously, I'm not coming in with a blindfold on,'' Low said. ''I may leave with a blindfold on. Just give me a smoke.'' SLAP SHOTS The Rangers' president and general manager, GLEN SATHER, admitted having an interest in signing CLAUDE LEMIEUX, who will be 35 when the season starts. ''Will I give him a four-year deal?'' Sather asked. ''No.'' . . . RON LOW on THEO FLEURY, the Rangers' biggest disappointment last season: ''He definitely wasn't the player I'd seen out West the last eight or nine years. Whatever the problems were, we have to solve them.'' . . . DON MALONEY was promoted to vice president for player development to go with his title of assistant general manager. HOCKEYDOORS and walls made of light-reflecting marble can be weighty, both in pounds and dollars. While the 3/4-inch marble used to face the loft's 450-pound wood and steel doors is $10 a square foot when unfinished, when cut, polished and installed, it costs as much as $100 a square foot. The cost of those doors plus the etched-glass bedroom door and the 60-foot-long wall, including marble, steel support and frame, clerestory and recessed lighting, was around $90,000, or about $1,500 a linear foot, said Derek Huntington, whose company, ZZZ Carpentry, built and installed them. Jeremy Lebensohn, in Brooklyn, fabricated the steel. There is, however, a less expensive way to build a similar wall. Mojdeh Baratloo, of Baratloo-Balch Architects, the firm that designed the loft, said that Venetian plaster comes close to marble in terms of reflecting light and can be applied on top of drywall, which weighs and costs relatively little. Venetian plaster begins with a layer or two of ordinary plaster and finishes with a mix of plaster, wax and tints. A craftsman might charge $15 to $20 a square foot to create a 3/4-inch wall of Venetian plaster, Mr. Huntington said. The drywall and installation would be extra.

Fortunately for the Yankees, they did not allow George Steinbrenner's wide-eyed desire for a big-name big hitter to prompt them to clean their shelves of minor league and other prospects. Instead of sending them in a package to Detroit for Gonzalez or to the Cubs for Sosa, they delivered some prospects to Cleveland for Justice, a creditable run producer, and others to Cincinnati for Neagle, the best starting pitcher available in the weeks leading up to the July 31 nonwaiver trading deadline. The Neagle acquisition was costly in prospects, but it was and will be costly economically, too. The Yankees' timing, in fact, is impeccable. Bud Selig, the commissioner with the payroll disparity problem, has summoned the owners to New York for a meeting tomorrow. There they will receive the report from a committee assigned the task of figuring out how to solve baseball's economic imbalance. The Yankees are Exhibit A of a team that spends money with no concern for the ramifications their expenditures have for their poorer relatives. Maybe that's the way it should be. The Yankees, after all, are engaged in a free-market, free-enterprise pursuit. Steinbrenner is out to win championships and make money. If spending a few extra million here or there produces a pennant and an invitation to the October dance, by all means spend the money. With the addition of Neagle and his $4.75 million salary, the Yankees' payroll, which passed the unprecedented $100 million milestone when Justice arrived, climbs still higher to about $107 million. But that's not the only economic element at work here. Two of the four minor leaguers the Yankees gave the Reds are Jackson Melian and Drew Henson. When Melian was a 16-year-old Venezuelan in 1996, the Yankees got him with a then-unprecedented $1.6 million signing bonus. When they drafted Henson two years ago, they bought a share of his future sports plans for a $2 million signing bonus. Henson was a top-notch high school quarterback who intended to play football in college. The Yankees made it worth his while to leave his options open and play baseball in the summer before playing football in the fall. Had they retained Henson and he had opted for the N.F.L., they would have eaten the $2 million and not suffered indigestion. But the Yankees have now taken that $3.6 million investment in Melian and Henson and used it to secure a pitcher who could put his left arm in their pitching dike and stem the tide that threatens to sweep them away from their October goal. And, of course, the Yankees don't want Neagle to work for them only for the rest of the season. With his free agency looming after the season, they will want to sign him -- and he's eager to accommodate them -- to a contract extension to keep him around. How would $9 million a year sound? The numbers that follow the dollar signs add to a big, big total. With the Yankees, it doesn't stop. The printing press in the basement at Yankee Stadium keeps pouring out the cash. If the secretaries and the executives think they have it tough having to be at their desks on time and not leaving a minute early in case the owner calls, what about those little old men running the money machine? They're not allowed to leave. Other teams find the playing surface uneven because the Yankees can afford to make mistakes, and most of them can't. Out in the international arena, the Yankees have signed Melian, Alfonso Soriano, Ricardo Aramboles, Hideki Irabu, Orlando Hernandez, Wily Mo Pena and Adrian Hernandez. If one or two of those remaining players and others fail to make it, the Yankees will balance the lost bonus against profits, shrug it off and pursue another unproven Latin or Asian kid. Most other teams feel they have to be more protective of their bonus money. They have to reduce the hit-or-miss ratio to as tiny a number as possible before committing a few million here or there. Who else last year would have given Pena, then a 17-year-old Dominican outfielder, $2.4 million to sign? The commissioner usually cringes when the Yankees make yet another move involving money (they all do, don't they?). Maybe this move, though, he will welcome, considering the timing. Maybe Selig can use this one, letting it incense the other owners to the point that it induces them to accept some radical form of revenue sharing the blue-ribbon task force might propose, Steinbrenner be damned.TOMAI-James Vincent. 79 years old.

Gooden had so many people plant their palms on his back after his five innings against the Mets last Saturday that he wondered if it was a dream. Had he ever left the Yankees? Could his comeback be this smooth? The answers came rushing forward before lunch yesterday when Gooden found out that the Yankees had acquired Denny Neagle from the Cincinnati Reds for four minor leaguers. Neagle's arrival surely signals that Gooden will be removed from the rotation, his improbable and inspirational story fading after five days. Five measly days. Gooden defeated his former team at Shea Stadium and gave the Yankees a surprising jolt, but he was given a jolt of another sort yesterday as his role drastically changed and his next start vanished. But Gooden refused to view it as a demotion. He is more humble after being discarded by two other teams this season, which is a smart strategy if he wants to continue surviving. ''I think it was a good move,'' Gooden said of the deal for Neagle. ''He's shown that he's still a good pitcher since he came back from that injury. When you can bring in another left-hander, you do it.'' Then Gooden laughed into the phone and said, ''What that means for me, I have no idea.'' Gooden's laugh was a curious laugh, not a nervous laugh. Less than a week from that splendid day in Flushing, his old playground, Gooden knows that he is a 35-year-old pitcher with question marks who is trying to hang on as desperately as any of the tribe members trying to win $1 million on ''Survivor.'' If Gooden criticizes Manager Joe Torre, gets into a scuffle with a cab driver or has a horrendous outing, all things he has done, George Steinbrenner, the only person whose vote matters on the Yankees' island, can squash Gooden's career as quickly as he rekindled it. So Gooden should be shrewder now, not bitter. It is the best way for him to act. It seemed unlikely that he would ever get another shot with the Yankees so he must savor it and seize it, even if he winds up as a long reliever behind the unsteady David Cone or as an insurance policy. It appears that Gooden will remain in the majors, but the Yankees have the option of returning him to the minor leagues. Before being promoted to pitch against the Mets on Saturday, he agreed contractually to accept a return to the minors. So the bullpen is better than demotion, or retirement. ''Three or four years ago, I would have said: 'I only want to start. I'm out of here and I'm going home,' '' Gooden said. ''But maybe it's time for me to make the change. I feel comfortable starting or relieving. Maybe the bullpen is the thing for me now.'' Gooden is serious. He has appeared in 413 major league games and has relieved only 7 times, but Gooden realizes the bullpen is the way to prolong his 16-year career. Mel Stottlemyre, the Yanks' pitching coach, was very intrigued when he heard Gooden express interest in relieving because Gooden had never uttered something like that to him. But even baseball survivalists must make concessions. The prospect of being a reliever is one reason Gooden is so enamored of the arm manipulation exercises that he does on a robotic machine a few times a week with Al Meilus, a trainer. Meilus said the exercises lengthen the muscles in Gooden's right arm, increase his range of motion and enable him to throw harder and freer. Gooden has already seen results since it takes him 10 minutes to warm up, a reduction from 20 minutes and an important development for a reliever. Two days before Gooden started against the Mets, Meilus said his fastball barely reached 87 miles an hour. But, after an intense session on the robotic machine, Gooden hit 89 and matched Al Leiter's fastball from one day earlier. Gooden claimed his fastball has been as robust as 92. ''My goal,'' Meilus said, ''is to get him to 95.'' It is a bold goal, but the Yankees do not need Gooden to throw 95 m.p.h. bullets. They simply need him to be reliable. The Yankees scrambled so much in June that they started rookies three times in one week. With the stellar Neagle, a possibly rejuvenated Gooden and a healthy Ramiro Mendoza, the Yankees should finally have some depth. Gooden actually referred to 1997 as evidence for why he can thrive in an uncertain role, another interesting sign since he had one relief outing in 20 games and maligned Torre for using him inconsistently. Now Gooden is embracing this insecure position because it is the only one available. Five days. Gooden had five days where he was back in the rotation with the Yankees and in a spot that he never envisioned five weeks ago. Now that Neagle's presence has altered the rotation for the better, Gooden must adjust again if he hopes to survive. ''I want to be a utility pitcher, just like we have utility players,'' Gooden said. ''I'll spot-start; I'll relieve. I'll do anything they want.''

The stated purpose of the bill is to restore the historic flows of fresh water that once made the Everglades one of the world's most wondrous and biologically diverse ecosystems. It will cost $8 billion over 20 years, shared by the federal government and Florida, and is the product of seven years of work by the Army Corps of Engineers, the environmental community and the Clinton administration. Its success so far in the Senate owes much to the two Florida senators, Connie Mack and Bob Graham. But most of the credit belongs to Bob Smith, a New Hampshire conservative whose stewardship of the bill has put to rest fears that he would not be as sympathetic to the Everglades as John Chafee, the reliable environmentalist who preceded him as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee and who died last year. But the bill is not a sure thing. What it needs now is a timely and powerful legislative push to get it through an uncertain House of Representatives and onto the president's desk before Washington is overwhelmed by the election campaign. To leave the bill until next year would be to commit it to the uncertain hands of a new Congress and, quite possibly, a new administration far less interested in conservation generally and the Everglades specifically than this one. Congress owes the Everglades restitution. More than 50 years ago, after back-to-back hurricanes that put much of South Florida under water, Congress ordered the Army Corps to drain a half-million acres south of Lake Okeechobee with a web of levees, canals and pumping stations. The result was to keep Florida's booming east coast free from floods and safe for development, and to create conditions under which the sugar cane industry could flourish. But it robbed the Everglades and Florida Bay of their traditional sources of fresh water, and nearly killed both. The Clinton administration, with the Senate's help, wants to set things right by recapturing and rerouting most of the 1.7 billion gallons of water that are wastefully flushed out to sea every day in the name of flood control. The bill specifically authorizes over $1 billion for the first 10 of 68 planned projects. Much of this money would be used to construct massive reservoirs to store Florida's copious rainwater that, at least in theory, will be delivered to the natural system through a redesigned network of canals and levees. The bill needs clarification. From the beginning, the state and the administration have quarreled over who should get most of the newly captured water -- the natural system, Florida's exploding cities, or agriculture. The administration has argued that nature, having been shortchanged for half a century, deserves top billing -- otherwise, why embark on this project at all? Florida, where the developers, the water utilities and sugar interests have great political power, has insisted on doing what it wants to. The bill says at one point that restoration is its ''overarching purpose.'' Elsewhere, however, it gives urban and agricultural needs equal weight. This is first and foremost a restoration bill, not a water supply bill for the cities and farms, and any ambiguities on this point must be cleared up. The bill should also provide a greater oversight role over the life of the project for the Interior Department, which manages about half the land to be restored. While making these fixes, the bill's supporters must also focus on building political momentum in the House, where opponents will try to create mischief. One person who could help move things forward is Jeb Bush, Florida's governor. He has promised $200 million, Florida's share of the project's first-year costs. But he has not shown the enthusiasm of his predecessor, Lawton Chiles, who courageously blocked efforts by the agricultural interests to exercise line-by-line veto power over the project through their friends in the state legislature. A more vigorous public commitment on his part would be welcome and might have real influence in the House. At risk is an irreplaceable natural asset that happens to be dying.A brief report by The Associated Press yesterday about a National Transportation Safety Board report on smoke detectors aboard cruise ships misstated the industry's position on the placement of detectors. The industry favors the use of smoke detectors in crew and passenger quarters, but wants them to sound an alarm only in a central monitoring location. It is not opposed to detectors in crew and passenger areas.The operators of Co-op City, the sprawling apartment development in the Bronx that is home to 60,000 mostly black and Hispanic residents, are being sued by 50 employees and residents who say they faced racial discrimination in the workplace and in the sales office of the complex. In the suit, which the plaintiffs plan to file this morning in State Supreme Court in the Bronx, the employees charge that they faced crude racial harassment at the hands of white co-workers and were denied promotions based on their race. The workers and tenants, all but one of whom are black or Hispanic, also say prospective black residents were steered into less desirable buildings, with preference given to whites. The suit names as defendants the Riverbay Corporation, Co-op City's owner; Marion Scott Real Estate Company, the development's private manager; and Steve Gold, the sales manager. Parts of the suit were provided yesterday to The New York Times. Jeffrey K. Brown, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the development's owners had ''systematically repressed minorities.'' ''They've done it through various mechanisms,'' he said. ''One is denial of advancements. Two is disparate treatment and three is a racially hostile and intimidating environment, where people are called the 'N' word, where people have feces smeared on their vehicles, where people are told not to place African-Americans and minorities in certain housing sections.'' The accusations were aggressively denounced by Marion Scott, president of Marion Scott Real Estate, which last year became the first private company to run Co-op City since the 1968 construction of its 35 towers, schools and retail centers in the northeast Bronx. Mr. Scott, who is African-American, called the claims ludicrous given that two-thirds of Co-op City's 925 employees and more than 70 percent of residents are black or Hispanic. He said he was incensed at charges that prospective black residents were steered toward ''black'' buildings or that their applications were shredded. He said state oversight of Co-op City prevents such bias. He also said creating hurdles for prospective minority residents would have been economically foolhardy, especially because the development had about 700 vacancies during the time that the plaintiffs are alleging the wrongdoing. ''We have outside bouncers throwing people in here, not throwing people out,'' he said. ''We were looking for anyone who had the money and the qualifications to apply.'' Mr. Scott also accused the Long Island law firm filing the suit, Leeds, Morelli & Brown, of being ''stick-up artists.'' He said the firm was trying to extort money from Co-op City with a frivolous case. Last week, Riverbay's lawyers filed a complaint with the New York State Grievance Committee of the 10th Judicial District, accusing Leeds, Morelli & Brown of trying to force Riverbay to pay $7.5 million in fees to pay for mediation to resolve the complaints and forgo litigation. Several plaintiffs remained adamant about their charges yesterday. Jaime Paredes, 57, said he kept running into obstacles when he tried to buy a two-bedroom apartment in a desirable area. He was rejected last September, he said. ''They're looking to put a white family in that apartment, not a Hispanic, and I'm a Hispanic,'' Mr. Paredes said. Brenda Brown, 48, a former Riverbay office worker and resident of Co-op City who is black, said she put up with racial taunts and watched white office workers make it difficult for blacks to move into Co-op City. Ms. Brown also said she was passed up for promotions. ''It's hostile,'' she said, ''when your face is black and you see injustices done.'' But Mr. Scott said Ms. Brown was fired in June 1999 after she was caught on videotape punching the time cards of fellow workers hours after the workers had finished their shift. As for Mr. Paredes's claims, Mr. Scott said people who are rejected often complain to regulators, though most claims are unfounded. ''If you look at the demographics of the young people who've rented, they're mostly black and Hispanics,'' Mr. Scott said. ''He might have been turned down for other reasons.''The bishops of the Episcopal Church, acting on the most contentious issue facing their denomination's General Convention, voted late today to reject a proposal that church officials develop rites to bless relationships between couples living together outside marriage, rituals that would probably be particularly applied to gay relationships. The vote, with 85 bishops against the proposal and 63 supporting it, came after more than three hours of debate, during which several of the prelates gathered here warned that were the proposal to pass, it could threaten the unity of the 2.4 million-member denomination, so severe are divisions among Episcopalians over what recognition to extend to gay and lesbian parishioners. Bishop Ed Little of the Diocese of Northern Indiana said he did not support the proposal ''because it will deepen our divisions.'' But another prelate, Catherine Roskam, a suffragan or auxiliary bishop of New York, called for supporting the development of the rites, saying, ''We have been pioneers in the ordination of women and we can be pioneers in this.'' The bishops' vote was the second time in two days that church leaders have rejected the proposal that an Episcopalian commission develop rites to be considered and voted upon at the next convention, which will be held in 2003. The convention, held every three years, is the church's top policy-making body, divided into two separate chambers, one composed of bishops, the other of clergy and lay people who are called ''deputies.'' On Tuesday, at the meeting at the Denver Convention Center, the House of Deputies voted against the proposal, but by a narrow margin. The proposal for the rites originally appeared as the eighth paragraph in an unusual resolution on sexuality that has been under consideration at the convention. After the deputies deleted that controversial paragraph, they overwhelmingly approved the resolution and sent it on to the bishops to consider. The resolution states that the church officially acknowledges that among the people in its pews are unmarried couples living in long-term relationships. It adds that although such relationships depart from traditional Christian teaching on sexuality, the church should give the couples involved its pastoral care and ''prayerful support.'' The statement makes no distinction between heterosexual and homosexual relationships -- and so implicitly includes both. The bishops have yet to vote on the resolution itself, although in their debate many expressed support for it, without the controversial eighth paragraph. The resolution is a carefully nuanced document, deploring promiscuity, declaring that Episcopalian leaders ''expect'' that nonmarital relationships will be monogamous and also noting that the church teaches that marriage is sanctified. The bishops' vote today centered on whether to amend the resolution to re-attach the eighth paragraph that the House of Deputies had rejected. Had that passed, the question would have been placed again before the House of Deputies, which could either re-affirm its earlier vote or change it. When they reconvene on Thursday, the bishops will consider another amendment to the resolution on whether a church commission should try in the next three years to find out whether it is possible to develop a theological basis for the blessing of relationships outside marriage. The broader question of how far a church should go in recognizing gay relationships is highly controversial among Episcopalians and many other Protestant denominations. Two weeks ago, the top policy-making body of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) passed an amendment to its constitution that would prohibit ministers from officiating at same-sex unions. The amendment must ratified by a two-thirds majority of the church's regional jurisdictions within the next year if it is to become law.GEORGE W. BUSH -- Pittsburgh and East Brunswick, N.J.

The 253-to-95 vote on Chief Justice David A. Brock culminated weeks of constitutional agony in New Hampshire, triggered by a nasty divorce. The divorce of one of the five Supreme Court justices led to an inquiry by the state attorney general into the court's practices, which led lawmakers to examine whether there were grounds for impeachment. Repeatedly today, House members decided that there were grounds to impeach Chief Justice Brock, though they spared two of his Supreme Court colleagues, Justices Sherman Horton and John Broderick. The House had last impeached a Supreme Court justice in 1790, and it had never before impeached a chief justice. The Republican-dominated House, by roughly 2 to 1, not particularly along party lines, approved four articles of impeachment against Chief Justice Brock, 64. They accused him of making a phone call to a Superior Court judge 13 years ago seeking to influence a case; of allowing the divorcing justice to influence the appointment of judges in his own case; of allowing judges to comment on cases from which they had recused themselves, and of repeatedly lying under oath. ''This investigation, if it accomplishes nothing else, has lifted the skirt of Lady Justice and taken a peek,'' said Henry P. Mock, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which recommended the impeachment. ''Did we see anything there that was really, really naughty? Not too bad, but we have seen things that were absolutely wrong. Not only that, but her blindfold slipped. Justice is blind, but she took a peek and she wasn't supposed to.'' Chief Justice Brock, who was not present today, has acknowledged that he made errors of judgment. But one of his lawyers, David Barry, said the chief justice contended that they were not impeachable conduct, and that he looked forward to the opportunity to clear his name. The House vote ''will be viewed as a historic aberration,'' Mr. Barry said, and possibly a dangerous one because ''it has lowered the impeachment bar and put at risk the independence of the judiciary.'' The Senate, advised by a former United States senator, George Mitchell, is expected to begin the trial next month, and even advocates of today's impeachment are predicting that Chief Justice Brock is likely to prevail there. ''They'll clean our clocks in the Senate,'' said Representative Tony F. Soltani, a Republican, pointing out that the Senate tends to be more sympathetic to the judiciary than the 400-seat House. Indeed, some opponents of impeachment today complained in the House hallways that they believed the impeachment was based not on the facts but on festering anger against the State Supreme Court for its 1997 ''Claremont'' decision requiring the state to revamp its heavily local system for financing schools. The state is still struggling to work out a new system. ''I think, because Brock was a substantial influence in getting the Claremont decision passed, that this was in part a great backlash against him,'' said Beth Rodd, Democrat of Bradford and formerly of Brooklyn. ''I don't feel that justice is being done. I feel there's a vindictive spirit, a mob mentality has taken over.'' But advocates of the impeachment said it was necessary to restore public confidence in the court. The divorcing justice, W. Stephen Thayer III, could influence the selection of judges for his divorce, while his wife could not, Mr. Soltani commented, and that ''is repulsive to me, repulsive beyond belief.'' Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, said today that she was committed to doing all she could to restore confidence in the courts, including pushing a constitutional amendment providing that judges be appointed for set terms rather than for life. The New Hampshire standards for impeachment are lower than the federal standards that became familiar to many during President Clinton's impeachment proceedings. It is enough, under New Hampshire law, for a judge to commit no ''high crime or misdemeanor'' but merely ''maladministration'' -- a word that lawmakers seemed to have trouble defining today. Some argued that since it was listed together with bribery and corruption, it must involve malice and ill-intent. Many speakers said today that the chief justice's main error had been one of compassion, in that he had felt sorry for Justice Thayer, and tried to help him. ''Are we going to hang a man for compassion?'' demanded one lawmaker, Richard Kennedy. But advocates of impeachment depicted the chief justice's misdeeds as too serious to be overlooked. He was accused of making a phone call in 1987 to a Superior Court judge who was hearing a contract dispute, and reminding him that one of the litigants was a powerful senator who could influence judicial pay increases. Chief Justice Brock has denied making such a call. He was also accused of committing ''maladministration'' in February when he informed Justice Thayer which judges he would appoint to a special panel needed to hear the Thayer divorce case because the Supreme Court justices had all recused themselves. When Chief Justice Brock made that announcement, witnesses said, Justice Thayer objected to one of the judges, and Chief Justice Brock tried to hold back the court clerk from calling that judge. Thus far, Chief Justice Brock has had little chance to mount his own defense. But his day will come in the Senate, Mr. Barry said. ''The citizens of New Hampshire should make no mistake,'' he said, ''this man has been on trial for three months now, and he's had no due process, no rights and no voice. This 'jury' that convicted him today has acted as a result of a one-sided process.''LAST year Lance Armstrong, of Austin, Tex., won the grueling Tour de France bicycle race after recovering from a brush with death from testicular cancer. Despite the attention Mr. Armstrong received, the United States remains one of the few places on earth where cycling fans can't get live television broadcasts of all 21 races that make up the Tour this year. That may be just as well. The time difference between here and France means that depending on where you are, catching an entire daily stage of the three-week Tour live would mean losing sleep or skipping work. But for cycling fans, temptation lurks in the form of the World Wide Web. Although it doesn't offer live video of cycling's most important race, at least one site has live audio in English and many others offer up-to-the-minute text reports. For those patient enough to wait until the action is over each day, the best Web sites for the race shame traditional American media in terms of the completeness of their information. The Societe du Tour de France was one of cycling's first governing bodies to use the Web. It remains the master. The most prominent feature of the site (www.letour.fr/2000/us) is a stream of text reports updating the race while it is underway. The updates are largely based on reports from spotters in cars and on motorcycles who travel close to the action. Known as Radio Tour, this system is the main source of information for nearly everyone following the race. Details of the route, a three-dimensional view of the mountains and, of course, every result and race statistic are available on the site. Elaborate graphics sometimes slow downloads. A new feature allows Web spectators to share an experience formerly limited to the press corps: the daily post-race news conferences. Now the whole world can watch the goings-on through Webcasts, which are sometimes translated into English. Web visitors can't ask questions, and when they see how stilted and artificial the news conferences generally are, they may be thankful. This portion of the site promises that visitors will ''experience it like you were there.'' Unfortunately, it follows through. A particular page on the French language part of the site is worth visiting even for those who can't read a word in the language. It is a photo gallery depicting parts of the publicity caravan, a shamelessly commercial parade of often bizarre vehicles (www.letour.fr/caravane /fr). It precedes the riders by about one hour and tries to amuse one of the world's largest live, captive audiences with noise, loud music and, above all, attractive young men and women who toss out trinkets, free product samples and empty shopping bags to hold all the junk. VeloNews is the only United States-based magazine devoted to bicycle racing, as opposed to training or equipment. This year the magazine has expanded its Tour de France coverage on the Web (www.greatoutdoors.com/velonews /race/road/00tdf). The experience of the magazine staff -- the editorial director, John Wilcockson, has followed the Tour for 32 years -- is apparent in its full race reports. Unfortunately several hours sometimes pass between the end of racing and their appearance. The site also offers the same updated race reports found at the official Tour de France site. Not all VeloNews journalists are professional writers. Three American professional riders in the race -- Tyler Hamilton, a teammate of Mr. Armstrong; Fred Rodriguez; and Chann McRae -- take turns producing a behind-the-scenes diary for the site. Mr. Hamilton, the most successful cyclist of the trio, is also the most promising writer. Although no one offers streaming video of the live race, Eurosport (tour2000.eurosport.com/home.asp ?LangueID=2) at least has a poor man's substitute. While the race is in progress, the satellite sports channel gives a streaming feed of the audio portion of its broadcasts. To reach it, users click on a button marked Radio Tour. Its English language television broadcast is mainly viewed in the United Kingdom, so the coverage pays particular -- sometimes excessive -- attention to riders from that country. Of course, TV without pictures has limitations. The early and ultimately meaningless portions of nonstrategic stages seem even more tedious without views of the attractive French countryside to pass the time. When something does happen, it can be frustrating to listen to Eurosport's announcers pick apart something from an invisible video replay. But this is as close to a live broadcast as Americans can get. The expert commentary on many stages is provided by Sean Kelly, a retired Irish rider who was once a leading Tour sprinter. Unfortunately, one famous (and very plausible) cycling legend is that the taciturn Mr. Kelly once shook his head to answer yes or no during a radio interview. A small daily video highlight package is also available. Its viewers might first want to turn their speakers off. The soundtrack is always a jarring mix of screams from the crowd and European disco music. The Web site of Lance Armstrong's United States Postal Service cycling team (www.uspsprocycling .com) offers two daily race reports. One is written by a team official, the other by a public affairs person from the sponsor. Neither is among the best reports available on the Web, but the site does have some interesting features, like the detailed description of a team bike by one of the team's mechanic, Geoff Brown, who also offers an essay on the mechanic's role in racing. There is also an excerpt from Mr. Armstrong's autobiography. Far more elaborate is Nike's Tour site, which is reached through the company's home page (www.nike .com), a sponsor of Mr. Armstrong and the supplier of his team's clothing. In addition to the usual daily stage reports, which focus mostly on Mr. Armstrong's analysis, the site has a number of video and multimedia features. That means that downloads can be taxing at dial-up modem speeds. The Tour de France began in 1903 as a publicity gimmick for the newspaper L'Auto, a predecessor of L'Equipe, a daily sports newspaper based in Paris. The yellow leader's jersey that Mr. Armstrong hopes to wear into Paris on July 23 is colored to match the paper on which both newspapers were once printed. The race and the newspaper are operated separately today but are part of the same corporate group. And no organization in the world covers the Tour as thoroughly as L'Equipe. For all the race participants, including the riders, it is the final word on the Tour. Unfortunately the newspaper's site (www.lequipe.fr) is costly by Web standards. Once users register by setting up an awkward online debit account, they can spend 1 Euro (about 95 cents) to buy the right to view a specific issue of the paper electronically for up to seven days. Dealing with L'Equipe's awkward online purchasing process is the least of most people's problems, because the site is written in French. But for cycling fans who read French or have a willing human translator or a reliable electronic one, there is no more complete Tour source.

During the course of her new book, ''Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation,'' Andrea Dworkin makes some extraordinary remarks aimed at bringing home her main point: that hatred of Jews and hatred of women are two closely related consequences of a similar thirst to dominate the weak. She quotes from a 1995 book on Arab women, for example, asserting that the Israeli Army ''may be the only one in the world'' whose members routinely ''sexually expose themselves'' as ''a means to disperse Arab women demonstrators or groups of women.'' Then, in a passage on the supposed subordination of women in Judaism, she cites a rabbinical interpretation of adultery that, according to Ms. Dworkin, allows men to be unfaithful to their wives. One result of this theological ruse, she writes, is that ''Orthodox Jews, post-Holocaust and in Israel, are major users of prostitutes.'' It is statements like these -- and there are numerous others in Ms. Dworkin's new book -- that illustrate the intemperate, extremist and intellectually seedy side to a book that in other respects is a learned and thought-provoking etiology of hatred through history. You don't have to be an avid supporter of Israel to feel a surge of skepticism over that report of routine exposure as a crowd-control method. Ms. Dworkin, however, ever ready to believe the worst about male behavior, accepts it and reproduces it without any visible attempt at verification. As for the frequency with which Israeli Orthodox men visit prostitutes, one is naturally led to ask how Ms. Dworkin would know that. She gives no source at all for this information, though her book is generally heavily footnoted. There are, in short, many problems with this passionate, overburdened and overwrought book, not the least of them that it is more an angry rant than a cogent, careful argument. Ms. Dworkin's main point is that the oppression both of women and of Jews through history, of which there has certainly been a horrifyingly large amount, reflects a kind of sexualized violence, a will to dominate. In this sense, she argues, the Jews have been turned into women by those who wanted to dominate them, the women into Jews. Or, as Ms. Dworkin puts it: ''Contempt for Jews is warranted because contempt for women is normative; both Jews and women have been locked in at night, Jews in ghettos, women in houses. Because, like women, Jews have not fought back, the men are taken to be biologically deviant in having none of the violent pride that distinguishes men from women.'' Leaving aside that subtly insinuated notion that violent pride is a universal male characteristic, there is certainly something to that argument, which Ms. Dworkin substantiates in a wide-ranging ramble through the rich history of human cruelty and depravity. She writes with stylistic eloquence and command, and she has read widely. Her new book is full of gripping passages on Nazi behavior, which Ms. Dworkin rightly sees as an apex of sexualized human cruelty, and she distills many of her ideas into pithy aphorisms: ''Every one of these rapists is a Nazi; and every one of the raped is a Jew: which is to say that rape is a manifestation of sexual fascism, the woman the scapegoated victim.'' Still, ''Scapegoat'' makes you think of one of those arcade games in which enemies are always appearing out of the scenery and you have to blow them away quickly, before you have a good chance to see exactly who they are, and Ms. Dworkin sees many enemies. Her overall conviction is that a sexualized will to dominate is a historical constant, one that women will escape only when they hold ultimate political power: ''Women either are the state or women are resubordinated.'' In this sense ''Scapegoat'' continues the themes already developed in past work by Ms. Dworkin, who has written many books on violence against women. Her comment about Orthodox men and prostitutes is part of a larger thesis developed in ''Scapegoat'': Israelis have overcompensated for the historical weakness of European Jews, their womanlike character of passivity in the face of oppression, by becoming macho dominators themselves, of women and of Palestinians, whose manhood has been taken away from them. ''Of course once Jewish men became physical, no longer gentle or weak, they had to own Jewish women in a new roughhouse sort of way,'' she writes. And then: ''In male culture the nature of women is simply a movable feast from whip wielder to abject victim; but both justify eventual male violence.'' But even if one shares Ms. Dworkin's natural horror at the prevalence of violence against women, and at such phenomena as female infanticide in China or the sexual apartheid practiced against women in some Muslim countries, ''Scapegoat'' remains untrustworthy, troubling in its extremism. Ms. Dworkin's book reads like a catalog of infamous things with what often seem to be isolated, or even aberrational instances, generalized to represent an unspeakable whole. Her summary of Jewish theology and practice contains so many half-truths and misinterpretations that it would take another book to refute them all. Suffice it to say that it is not true that 613 of the religious commandments apply to men and only 2 to women, or that women granted divorces by religious courts in Israel are required to exit the scene bowing gratefully to their husbands. Ms. Dworkin's indefatigable quest for the violence of the male culture leads her to range widely. For example, she cites the practice of suttee -- by which widows are burned alive on the funeral pyres of their husbands -- to represent pretty much the whole of the female condition in India. Nowhere does she tell us how widespread this barbaric and illegal practice is, but she does make this rather remarkable declaration: ''In India, women can be murdered with impunity any time in life.'' No reasonable person would declare India to be a feminist paradise, but Ms. Dworkin's unsubstantiated allegations show more of a superheated imagination than assiduous research. The unreliability of her reporting, the very avidity of her quest to prove the absolute inevitability of testosterone-driven violence, transforms ''Scapegoat'' from scholarship to a kind of agitprop and spoils what might otherwise have been a vigorous explanation for the worst in human behavior. BOOKS OF THE TIMESDrivers have been paying almost twice as much for gasoline at Kenneth Cerny's service station as they did a few years ago, but Mr. Cerny is a poorer man for it. His Cerny's Midway Market sells gas under the Citgo brand in Mukwonago, Wis., where prices soared to over $2 a gallon last month after pipeline problems and new federal clean-fuel rules crimped Midwest supplies. Customers have been furious. ''All they understand is what they see at the gas pump,'' Mr. Cerny said. But the price he pays for his gasoline has risen faster than the price he can charge customers and still stay competitive, he said. For many independent operators, who own most of the country's service stations and convenience stores, rising gas prices have brought little benefit, and in some regions they have actually made it tougher to do business. But elsewhere along the chain that takes oil from the ground to the filling station, higher prices have meant sharply higher profits -- for producers and refiners. Major oil companies are expected to post average earnings growth of 121 percent for the three months ended in June, compared with the period last year, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Exploration and production companies are expected to report average increases of 371 percent. Even refiners, who have suffered through two years of very thin profits, are seeing profits double or triple. With a host of politicians, including Vice President Al Gore, demanding an investigation of ''price gouging,'' the Federal Trade Commission has started an inquiry into possible industry collusion. Why are profits up so sharply? Collusion by OPEC has clearly played a role. The primary reason crude oil prices have risen sharply -- the biggest factor in the leap in gasoline prices -- was the decision by the cartel's ministers in March 1999 to curtail oil production. Despite two production increases this year, and Saudi Arabia's plan to raise output by another 500,000 barrels a day, oil hovers at close to $30 a barrel, almost triple the low prices of early last year. With their costs remaining much the same but the price they're being paid for oil rising sharply, oil producing nations and companies are doing far better. For example, the largest United States oil producers generally see their profits rise about 6 percent for every $1 increase in crude oil prices, according to Bruce Lanni, an industry analyst at CIBC World Markets. An even more drastic turnabout in profits has come in the refining business, the middle step between pumping oil from the ground and pumping gas into cars. Refiners take crude oil and ''crack'' it into refined products, including gas, heating oil and jet fuel. This is done by major integrated oil companies, like Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Tex., as well as by independents, like the Valero Energy Corporation, based in San Antonio, and the Tosco Corporation, based in Stamford, Conn. Before gas prices started their rise last year, drivers reaped the benefits of both low crude prices and slim margins for refiners. For refiners, though, it was a very painful period, as overcapacity and stiff competition cut profits, making last year the worst for the industry in more than a decade, analysts say. Refining ''is just a horrible business,'' said Paul Y. Cheng, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. But this year has brought at least temporary relief to refiners, and that is not simply because of higher oil prices. Refiners profit if the price of gas and heating oil rises faster than the price of crude. That is what happened this year, analysts say, as strong demand and low inventories allowed refiners to sell their product on the spot market at higher and higher prices, which were then passed on to the marketing companies, distributors and wholesalers that deliver gas to the pump. Refiners use the term ''crack spread'' to describe the gap between what it costs them to buy crude oil and the price they get for selling gas and other refined products. As 1999 came to a close, spreads were thin, but a late blast of winter in the Northeast caused demand for heating oil to soar, lifting prices and margins. Spreads improved further during the spring, as it became clear that domestic gas inventories were quite low even as demand for gas was accelerating with the strong economy and the approach of the summer driving season. And they widened even more in May and June as low inventories, supply disruptions and the federally mandated introduction of a new type of reformulated gas caused pump prices to soar, especially in the Midwest. Before, ''you had low crude prices and an oversupply, which led to cutthroat competition and a period of companies trying to liquidate inventories into a market that was oversold,'' said Arthur L. Smith, the chief executive of John S. Herold Inc., an industry researcher. ''That has reversed, and now you have high crude prices to pass through, and you can pass them through because inventories are down.'' Refining margins across the United States averaged $6.64 a barrel in the second quarter, compared with $3.27 in the period last year, according to calculations by Mr. Lanni. In the Midwest, where a pipeline break and a shortage of new reformulated gas caused the worst spike in retail prices, margins averaged $9.45 a barrel for the period -- topping $17 at one point -- compared with $3.18 the year before. Spreads ''this year are better than they have ever been,'' said William E. Greehey, Valero's chief executive. ''We entered the season with low inventories, demand has been strong and distillate inventories are still very low.'' Whether the oil industry is profiting excessively is a matter of debate. President Clinton, for example, has said there is ''no economic explanation'' for the surge in prices, particularly in the Midwest. But industry analysts say the industry is merely doing what many other businesses, from makers of software to makers of sport utility vehicles, are doing: pricing aggressively and opportunistically to maximize profits. Philip K. Verleger, a senior advisor to the Brattle Group, an economic consulting firm, who has served on several federal and state investigations into accusations of oil industry collusion, said past efforts to pin price-fixing charges on the industry had had little success. ''When I served on these things, and every time I talked to F.T.C. economists, nobody can find anything,'' he said. After peaking three weeks ago the price of gas is now falling. Regular gas is now $1.59 a gallon -- both nationally and in the Midwest -- down from $1.68 nationally and $1.87 in the Midwest. Looking ahead, industry officials say that while the recent drop in gas prices had caused refinery spreads to narrow in the last few weeks, a potential shortage in heating oil should keep profits strong during the second half of the year. Analysts say that by October, the nation needs inventories of heating oil and similar distillates of at least 135 million barrels to ensure that prices are somewhat stable during the winter. But inventories are now at 109 million barrels, and with many refiners still focused on capturing the wide spreads from gas, it is not certain that heating oil inventories will reach more normal levels by the time cold weather arrives. And since the price of natural gas has also risen sharply this year, that is expected to add to demand for heating oil. ''The market is so tight right now that any refinery that goes down is going to cause a disruption,'' Mr. Greehey said, ''and if we have any kind of winter, we're going to see people complaining about fuel oil prices like they were complaining about gas prices in the Midwest.'' The recent drop in wholesale gas prices has brought some relief to service station and convenience store owners, but it may be a while before they recover from the whipsawing they suffered in May and June, when wholesale prices soared. In March and early April, many retailers enjoyed widening margins as wholesale prices fell. But that reversed quickly, and their margins contracted severely across much of the nation, especially in the Midwest and West Coast. The average national wholesale price of regular gas leaped 37 cents, to $1.19 a gallon, between April 13 and June 22, according to the Oil Price Information Service, which tracks gas prices. Over the same time, the average retail pump price rose just 15 cents, to $1.65. Owners of service stations say that their business is too competitive to enable them to pass all their price increases to customers immediately. ''On the way up, retail tends to lag, so in a fast-rising market a retailer can get really squeezed,'' said Kevin J. Lindemer, who tracks refining at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''When the market starts to fall, it depends on how aggressive the competition is, you can recover a little bit of that margin, but that's not always the case.'' Service station and convenience store owners have had to contend with other problems. For example, in regions of the nation where station owners shy away from requiring drivers to prepay, the number of ''drive-offs'' has soared, according to industry associations, as customers apparently feel more justified stealing gas. Bill Douglas, who owns nine service stations and runs a gasoline distribution company in Sherman, Tex., has been losing $1,000 a month in drive-offs recently at his largest stations. In at least five states, new laws have gone into effect this year requiring people who repeatedly steal gas to lose their license. And service station owners are being squeezed in other ways: with gas prices so much higher, the value of a typical station's inventory has soared, making it more costly to finance. Many gas credit cards often charge 3 percent of the transaction amount as a fee, so station owners are paying more in credit card fees. ''Everybody that I meet thinks I'm getting rich. They say, 'I bet you're really enjoying these high prices,' '' Mr. Douglas said. ''But cashiers take the brunt of it. They get insulted regularly.''INTO every dark loft, a lot of light can fall. When Dr. Tilman Friedrich and his wife, Carlota Vollhardt, bought their 2,500-square-foot TriBeCa loft in 1998, they chose it for its location. It was in an 1860 building, once a warehouse for cheese and eggs, on a street graced with a triangular park. Moreover, their favorite restaurants were only a few blocks away. There was, however, just one thing wrong. Like many lofts, apartments and town houses, their loft had windows only at each end (north and south), and darkness in between. But the couple had an idea: a marble wall that would make the light pouring in from the three south-facing windows dance halfway down the loft, from early morning into the afternoon. ''Originally, the idea was a backlit onyx wall,'' said Dr. Friedrich, a cardiologist who works for Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, who added that the idea of the wall came from his friend, Uwe Drapper, an architect in Berlin. ''But I thought onyx walls were like the walls of Chinese restaurants.'' He and his wife, an organizational psychologist, also with Pfizer, prefer a crisp, clean modernist aesthetic. They like their clothes black, their walls white and their chairs by Mies van der Rohe. The loft is partly a pied-a-terre. Dr. Friedrich works in Manhattan, while Ms. Vollhardt commutes between Pfizer offices in New York and Groton, Conn. Although they have a house on Long Island Sound, they are profoundly urban. ''Before Groton, we have always been in cities,'' Dr. Friedrich said. When they were students in Berlin, they lived in an industrial loft, complete with a bar. In TriBeCa, they wanted to replicate the loft and bar, but without the restrictions of a student budget. After all, this is a couple who dine at Chanterelle and Danube on a monthly basis. ''I wanted a marble wall, something quiet but strong,'' Dr. Friedrich said. ''We wanted a large living area because we love to cook.'' He is the kind of weekend chef who makes sauces from stock reductions involving beef bones roasted then simmered for hours on end. Her specialty is pastry. They both love stone, and they wanted it on counters, bar and kitchen floor. And they wanted everything suffused with light. So when they hired Clifton Balch and Mojdeh Baratloo, of Baratloo-Balch Architects in Manhattan, they didn't have a wish list. They had a must-do list. Together, the architects and clients chose a white Alabama marble, whose beautiful veins, in shades of charcoal darkening to black, look like a Chinese brush painting. Mr. Balch took Polaroids of the 23 slabs of 3/4-inch marble and handed them to Dr. Friedrich, who rearranged the Polaroids, as in a game of Solitaire, until he had exactly the effect he wanted. ''We tried the marble two ways, polished and also honed for a matte finish,'' Ms. Baratloo said. ''It's the polished nature that reflects the light and brings out the pattern.'' The steel-framed wall has three flush doors, which open onto two home offices and a bathroom between. Each door -- solid wood, clad in marble and steel -- weighs 450 pounds. The workmanship is so fine that the doors glide open, smoothly and silently. To maximize the light, the architects designed a clerestory above the seven-foot-high, 60-foot-long marble wall, so that sunlight travels along the ceiling. Recessed fluorescent lighting beneath the clerestory makes the ceiling glow at night. The architects also designed a translucent acid-etched glass door for the bedroom at the southern end of the loft. Open or closed, the door allows light to travel down the hall. The couple now inhabit a bright new box inside an old brick shell. ''All the new materials are rich and sleek,'' Ms. Vollhardt said, ''and the old ones are rough.'' Just as the rear of the loft is private, the front is designed to be a place where friends can perch at the granite-covered kitchen counter, perhaps peeling potatoes while their host poaches sea bass. Or they can sit at the 1950's-inspired curvy bar, a collaboration between the architects and the clients. ''Everything is hard-edged, and this is curvilinear,'' Mr. Balch said. To Ms. Vollhardt, the bar is more than a curve tucked into a rectangle. ''It's about playfulness,'' she said. Granite was chosen for bar and countertop because it is tougher than marble, and they found some with a sinuous pattern. The Bulthaup kitchen system, imported from Germany, is so precisely engineered it looks like a NASA space station, with the equally precise Dr. Friedrich at the controls. The kitchen floor is a soapstone whose deep, dusky color was chosen to complement blue-gray lacquer cabinets. Even the fireplace is crisp and pristine. The architects cut rectangles for the hearth and for the firewood, and framed them with more light-reflecting marble. Along with the luxury of light is the warmth of wood, whether it's the larch wood cabinetry, the oak floors or Ms. Vollhardt's family heirlooms. When Ms. Vollhardt's parents traveled through Spain in the 1940's, they bought a a 15th-century table from a priest at a Renaissance church. Today, it is a coffee table in a modern loft in TriBeCa. ''He didn't want to use it anymore,'' Ms. Vollhardt said, ''because it was old.'' HOUSE PROUD\""

              " \"During the course of her new book, ''Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation,'' Andrea Dworkin makes some extraordinary remarks aimed at bringing home her main point: that hatred of Jews and hatred of women are two closely related consequences of a similar thirst to dominate the weak.\",\n",
              " \"She quotes from a 1995 book on Arab women, for example, asserting that the Israeli Army ''may be the only one in the world'' whose members routinely ''sexually expose themselves'' as ''a means to disperse Arab women demonstrators or groups of women.''\",\n",
              " 'Then, in a passage on the supposed subordination of women in Judaism, she cites a rabbinical interpretation of adultery that, according to Ms. Dworkin, allows men to be unfaithful to their wives.',\n",
              " \"One result of this theological ruse, she writes, is that ''Orthodox Jews, post-Holocaust and in Israel, are major users of prostitutes.''\",\n",

              " \"You don't have to be an avid supporter of Israel to feel a surge of skepticism over that report of routine exposure as a crowd-control method.\",\n",
              " 'Ms. Dworkin, however, ever ready to believe the worst about male behavior, accepts it and reproduces it without any visible attempt at verification.',\n",
              " 'As for the frequency with which Israeli Orthodox men visit prostitutes, one is naturally led to ask how Ms. Dworkin would know that.',\n",
              " 'She gives no source at all for this information, though her book is generally heavily footnoted.',\n",
              " 'There are, in short, many problems with this passionate, overburdened and overwrought book, not the least of them that it is more an angry rant than a cogent, careful argument.',\n",
              " \"Ms. Dworkin's main point is that the oppression both of women and of Jews through history, of which there has certainly been a horrifyingly large amount, reflects a kind of sexualized violence, a will to dominate.\",\n",
              " 'In this sense, she argues, the Jews have been turned into women by those who wanted to dominate them, the women into Jews.',\n",
              " \"Or, as Ms. Dworkin puts it: ''Contempt for Jews is warranted because contempt for women is normative; both Jews and women have been locked in at night, Jews in ghettos, women in houses.\",\n",
              " \"Because, like women, Jews have not fought back, the men are taken to be biologically deviant in having none of the violent pride that distinguishes men from women.''\",\n",
              " 'Leaving aside that subtly insinuated notion that violent pride is a universal male characteristic, there is certainly something to that argument, which Ms. Dworkin substantiates in a wide-ranging ramble through the rich history of human cruelty and depravity.',\n",
              " 'She writes with stylistic eloquence and command, and she has read widely.',\n",
              " \"Her new book is full of gripping passages on Nazi behavior, which Ms. Dworkin rightly sees as an apex of sexualized human cruelty, and she distills many of her ideas into pithy aphorisms: ''Every one of these rapists is a Nazi; and every one of the raped is a Jew: which is to say that rape is a manifestation of sexual fascism, the woman the scapegoated victim.''\",\n",
              " \"Still, ''Scapegoat'' makes you think of one of those arcade games in which enemies are always appearing out of the scenery and you have to blow them away quickly, before you have a good chance to see exactly who they are, and Ms. Dworkin sees many enemies.\",\n",
              " \"Her overall conviction is that a sexualized will to dominate is a historical constant, one that women will escape only when they hold ultimate political power: ''Women either are the state or women are resubordinated.''\",\n",
              " \"In this sense ''Scapegoat'' continues the themes already developed in past work by Ms. Dworkin, who has written many books on violence against women.\",\n",
              " \"Her comment about Orthodox men and prostitutes is part of a larger thesis developed in ''Scapegoat'': Israelis have overcompensated for the historical weakness of European Jews, their womanlike character of passivity in the face of oppression, by becoming macho dominators themselves, of women and of Palestinians, whose manhood has been taken away from them.\",\n",
              " \"''Of course once Jewish men became physical, no longer gentle or weak, they had to own Jewish women in a new roughhouse sort of way,'' she writes.\",\n",
              " \"And then: ''In male culture the nature of women is simply a movable feast from whip wielder to abject victim; but both justify eventual male violence.''\",\n",
              " \"But even if one shares Ms. Dworkin's natural horror at the prevalence of violence against women, and at such phenomena as female infanticide in China or the sexual apartheid practiced against women in some Muslim countries, ''Scapegoat'' remains untrustworthy, troubling in its extremism.\",\n",
              " \"Ms. Dworkin's book reads like a catalog of infamous things with what often seem to be isolated, or even aberrational instances, generalized to represent an unspeakable whole.\",\n",
              " 'Her summary of Jewish theology and practice contains so many half-truths and misinterpretations that it would take another book to refute them all.',\n",
              " 'Suffice it to say that it is not true that 613 of the religious commandments apply to men and only 2 to women, or that women granted divorces by religious courts in Israel are required to exit the scene bowing gratefully to their husbands.',\n",
              " \"Ms. Dworkin's indefatigable quest for the violence of the male culture leads her to range widely.\",\n",
              " 'For example, she cites the practice of suttee -- by which widows are burned alive on the funeral pyres of their husbands -- to represent pretty much the whole of the female condition in India.',\n",
              " \"Nowhere does she tell us how widespread this barbaric and illegal practice is, but she does make this rather remarkable declaration: ''In India, women can be murdered with impunity any time in life.''\",\n",
              " \"No reasonable person would declare India to be a feminist paradise, but Ms. Dworkin's unsubstantiated allegations show more of a superheated imagination than assiduous research.\",\n",
              " \"The unreliability of her reporting, the very avidity of her quest to prove the absolute inevitability of testosterone-driven violence, transforms ''Scapegoat'' from scholarship to a kind of agitprop and spoils what might otherwise have been a vigorous explanation for the worst in human behavior.\",\n",
